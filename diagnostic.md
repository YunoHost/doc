# Diagnose YunoHost functioning

To diagnose that all critical aspects of your server are properly configured,
you should run a diagnosis from the webadmin in the "Diagnosis" section. (This
feature was added in YunoHost 3.8).

TODO: elaborate on the fact that the diagnosis runs periodically, sends an email
to root which is forwarded to the very first user created, and that issues
should either be fixed or ignored (if they are understood/not relevant)
otherwise an email will be sent twice a day..
