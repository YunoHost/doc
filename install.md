#Installation guide

You have two ways to install YunoHost:

1. From an USB key or a CD-ROM (below guide)
2. [On an existing Debian](/#/install_on_debian)

### Pre-requisite

* An x86 [compatible machine](/#/compatible_hardware) dedicated to YunoHost. Be careful not to have any unsaved data on it.
* Another computer to read this guide and access your server.
* A [reasonable ISP](/#/isp), with a good upload bandwidth, unlimited download/upload, and tolerant to self-hosting.
* A USB key (via [Unetbootin](http://unetbootin.net/more-infos-and-get-it/)) or a CD burned with the latest YunoHost ISO: http://build.yunohost.org

### Boot on CD-ROM drive or USB key

Boot up your server with your USB key or your CD-ROM inserted, and select it as bootable device by pressing one of the following key (hardware specific): ```<ESC>```, ```<F8>```, ```<F10>```, ```<F11>```, ```<F12>``` ou ```<SUPPR>```
