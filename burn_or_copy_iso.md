Put your USB key on, select your YunoHost ISO and click "Flash"


### With `dd`

If you know your way around command line, you may also flash your USB key with
`dd`. Assuming your USB key is `/dev/sdb` (be careful !!), you may run :

```bash
dd if=/path/to/yunohost.iso of=/dev/sdb
```

## CD/DVD

The software to use differs regarding your operating system.

* On Windows, use [ImgBurn](http://www.imgburn.com/) to write the image file on the disc

* On Mac OS, use [Disk Utility](http://support.apple.com/kb/ph7025)

* On GNU/Linux, you have plenty of choices, like [Brasero](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Brasero) or [K3b](http://www.k3b.org/)
