Fallback is a special app, only by command line interface, which provide a way to have a secondary server which you can used if your main server goes down.
This other server will allow you to deploy a copy of your server to bring back you to internet during your break down.

## Configuration

After the installation, you should not have anything else to configure. If you want anyway, you can find the list of app to backup in the file `/home/yunohost.app/fallback/app_list` and a global configuration in this other file `/home/yunohost.app/fallback/config.conf`
