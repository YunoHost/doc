## Via GitHub

The YunoHost documentation is managed through a [Git repository](https://github.com/YunoHost/doc).

If you are not familiar with GitHub, there is an "Edit" button at the top of each page that will redirect you to the GitHub online editor that will help you make  change proposals (Pull Requests).

Directly on GitHub, you can fork the repository, make your changes, and send pull requests.

Because the online editor doesn't support uploading files, using Git is the prefered way if you need to upload media (e.g. images).

## Grav

Under the hood, the documentation is served by the [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org/?target=_blank).

The structure of the repository is described below:

```bash
+-- config
   +-- site.yaml
   +-- system.yaml
   +-- themes
       +-- yunohost-docs.yaml
          # Some settings for the documentation theme
+-- images
   # Contains the images used in the documentation pages.
+-- pages
   # The directory containing the documentation pages.
   # The pages hierarchy is reflected by the directory hierarchy.
   +-- 00.home
   +-- 01.administrate
   +-- 02.applications
   +-- 03.community
   +-- 04.contribute
+-- themes
    +-- learn4
    +-- yunohost-docs
       # Contains the theme's code, which extends Learn4 theme's code
+-- .gitignore
    # Contains the instructions to not send sensitive
    # or useless files over to the Git repository
+-- README.md
```

!!!! To learn more about Grav's features, you can head over to its [documentation](https://learn.getgrav.org?target=_blank). The remainder of this page will show you some specific instructions to contribute to YunoHost's documentation.

## Grav header

Each page starts with a header that gives instructions to Grav on how to process them. Let us have a look into the header of this page:

```
---
title: Write documentation
template: docs
taxonomy:
    category: docs
routes:
  default: '/write_documentation'
---

```

1. The header starts and ends with a line containing `---`
2. The `title` key manages the first heading title of the page, its name in the navigation menu on the left, and its name in the browser tab
3. `template` and `taxonomy` keys should always be left as is. They instruct Grav to use the proper theme and order the pages properly.
4. `routes`' `default` key makes the page available by default on `https://yunohost.org/docs/write_documentation` instead of needing to reaching it on `https://yunohost.org/docs/contribute/write_documentation`, which is where it is stored in the directory hierarchy.

## Syntax

You can use Markdown syntax, refer to the [documentation](/doc_markdown_guide) for further information.

! Note that language codes are not to be included at the beginning of the links to other documentation pages: `/en`, `/fr`, etc. are superfluous.

To improve Markdown capabilities, additional plugins are installed in Grav. You can refer to their own documentation on GitHub to see how to use them.
```text
anchors
external_links
flex-objects
highlight
image-captions
markdown-notices
presentation
presentation-deckset
shortcode-core
```

## Special pages

Some pages of the documentation are automatically or dynamically generated.

| Page          | Path  | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| Apps catalog  | `/pages/02.applications/01.catalog/apps.md` | Retrieves and processes [app.json](https://github.com/YunoHost/apps/blob/master/apps.json?target=_blank) |
| Apps helpers  | `pages/04.contribute/04.packaging_apps/11.helpers/packaging_apps_helpers.md` | Generated by this [script](https://github.com/YunoHost/yunohost/blob/dev/doc/generate_helper_doc.py?target=_blank), from this [template](https://github.com/YunoHost/yunohost/blob/dev/doc/helper_doc_template.md?target=_blank) |
| Per-app documentation | `pages/02.applications/02.docs/docs.md` | Lists the subpages in the same directory which have `taxonomy.category: docs, apps` in its header |
