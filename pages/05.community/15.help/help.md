## How to ask for help

[columns count=2 width=200px]
!!!! - **Be courteous**: help in the chatrooms or on the forum is given by our users and contributors, all volunteers.
!!!! - **Explain the context** of your request in a complete but concise way.
!!!! - It is paramount to **share the error logs with YunoPaste** (green buttons in your webadmin, then share the link to the generated page).
!!!! - **Be patient**, as your messages might not be seen instantly.

!! - Do not ask about your attempted solution but rather your actual problem (see [XY problem](https://xyproblem.info/)).
!! - Avoid phrases like "server does not want", "the app does not load", or other meaningless sentences.
!! - Do not trim error messages, but do not paste a wall of illegible unformatted code either. (Use [YunoPaste](https://paste.yunohost.org))
!! - Do not ask your question like a poll ("does anyone else succeeded in...?").
