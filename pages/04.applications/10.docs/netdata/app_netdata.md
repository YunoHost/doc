[NetData](http://my-netdata.io/) is a system for **distributed real-time performance and health monitoring**.
It provides **unparalleled insights, in real-time**, of everything happening on the
system it runs (including applications such as web and database servers), using
**modern interactive web dashboards**.

_netdata is **fast** and **efficient**, designed to permanently run on all systems
(**physical** & **virtual** servers, **containers**, **IoT** devices), without
disrupting their core function._

[![Install NetData with YunoHost](https://install-app.yunohost.org/install-with-yunohost.png)](https://install-app.yunohost.org/?app=netdata)

**Customization brought by the package:**

* grant MySQL statistics access via a `netdata` user
* NGINX root log statistics via putting `netdata` user in the `adm` group
* Dovecot statistics via giving access to Dovecot stats stocket to `netdata` user (works only with Dovecot 2.2.16+)

**Further recommendations:**
We don't allow YunoHost packages to make sensible changes to system files. So here are further customizations you can make to allow more monitoring:

* NGINX: 
  * requests/connections: follow [these recommandations](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/tree/master/python.d#nginx) to enable `/stab_status` (for example by putting the `location` section in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/yunohost_admin.conf`
  * weblogs: you can monitor all your NGINX weblogs for errors; follow [these recommendations](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/tree/master/python.d#nginx_log)
* PHP-FPM: follow [these recommandations](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/tree/master/python.d#phpfpm)

 - **Stunning interactive bootstrap dashboards**<br/>
   mouse and touch friendly, in 2 themes: dark, light

 - **Amazingly fast**<br/>
   responds to all queries in less than 0.5 ms per metric,
   even on low-end hardware

 - **Highly efficient**<br/>
   collects thousands of metrics per server per second,
   with just 1% CPU utilization of a single core, a few MB of RAM and no disk I/O at all

 - **Sophisticated alarming**<br/>
   hundreds of alarms, **out of the box**!<br/>
   supports dynamic thresholds, hysteresis, alarm templates,
   multiple role-based notification methods (such as email, slack.com,
   pushover.net, pushbullet.com, telegram.org, twilio.com, messagebird.com)

 - **Extensible**<br/>
   you can monitor anything you can get a metric for,
   using its Plugin API (anything can be a NetData plugin,
   BASH, Python, Perl, Node.JS, Java, Go, Ruby, etc.)

 - **Embeddable**<br/>
   it can run anywhere a Linux kernel runs (even IoT)
   and its charts can be embedded on your web pages too

 - **Customizable**<br/>
   custom dashboards can be built using simple HTML (no JavaScript necessary)

 - **Zero configuration**<br/>
   auto-detects everything, it can collect up to 5000 metrics
   per server out of the box

 - **Zero dependencies**<br/>
   it is even its own web server, for its static web files and its web API

 - **Zero maintenance**<br/>
   you just run it, it does the rest

 - **scales to infinity**<br/>
   requiring minimal central resources

 - **several operating modes**<br/>
   autonomous host monitoring, headless data collector, forwarding proxy, store and forward proxy, central multi-host monitoring, in all possible configurations.
   Each node may have different metrics retention policy and run with or without health monitoring.

 - **time-series back-ends supported**<br/>
   can archive its metrics on `graphite`, `opentsdb`, `prometheus`, JSON document DBs, in the same or lower detail
   (lower: to prevent it from congesting these servers due to the amount of data collected)

## What does it monitor?

netdata collects several thousands of metrics per device.
All these metrics are collected and visualized in real-time.

> _Almost all metrics are auto-detected, without any configuration._

This is a list of what it currently monitors:

- **CPU**<br/>
  usage, interrupts, softirqs, frequency, total and per core, CPU states

- **Memory**<br/>
  RAM, swap and kernel memory usage, KSM (Kernel Samepage Merging), NUMA

- **Disks**<br/>
  per disk: I/O, operations, backlog, utilization, space, software RAID (md)
