[![Install Converse with YunoHost](https://install-app.yunohost.org/install-with-yunohost.svg)](https://install-app.yunohost.org/?app=converse) [![Integration level](https://dash.yunohost.org/integration/converse.svg)](https://dash.yunohost.org/appci/app/converse)

*Converse* is a free and open-source XMPP chat client written in JavaScript which can be tightly integrated into any website.

The benefit of using converse.js as opposed to relying on a SaaS (software-as-a-service) solution, is that your users can have a much more customized, streamlined and integrated webchat experience and that you have control over the data. The latter being a requirement for many sites dealing with sensitive information.
