*Searx* is a free and decentralized meta-search engine. The queries made are not saved by Searx in order to protect the privacy of the user. As a metasearch engine, searx collects and displays results from dozens of search engines. The search engines used (or not) can be configured in the preferences.
As a decentralized software, searx is installed on different instances (different servers). In France, associations such as Framasoft, Aquilenet or La Quadrature du Net have installed it on their servers.
