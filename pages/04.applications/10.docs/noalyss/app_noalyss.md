Open source accounting software developed in PHP.

All the information on this software is available on the [project website](http://www.noalyss.eu).

To learn how to use it I invite you to read the [user documentation of the project](https://www.noalyss.eu/?page_id=1031).

The GitHub of the YunoHost module is [here](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/noalyss_ynh_ynh).

You can try the project [here](http://demo.noalyss.eu/index.php) with the identifiers: demo / demo

The administrator IDs and passwords for the first login are those defined during the package installation (sent as a memo to the email address of this app's administrator at your YNH domain).
