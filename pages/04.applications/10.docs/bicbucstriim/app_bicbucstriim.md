*BicBucStriim* streams books, digital books. It was primarily designed to fill a gap in the functionality of NAS devices that provide access to music, videos and photos -- but not books. BicBucStriim fills this gap and provides web-based access to your e-book collection.

## Disclaimers / important information

BicBucStriim is a simple PHP application that runs in the Apache/PHP environment provided by the NAS (or any other server). It assumes that you manage your e-book collection with Calibre. The application reads the Calibre data and publishes it in HTML form. To access the e-book catalog you simply point your ebook reader to your NAS, select one of your e-books and download it.

## Configuration

A freshly installed BicBucStriim installation will show the login page. The initial login information for the administrator is
    user name: admin
    password : admin
