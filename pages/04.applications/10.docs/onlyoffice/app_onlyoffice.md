[![Install OnlyOffice with YunoHost](https://install-app.yunohost.org/install-with-yunohost.png)](https://install-app.yunohost.org/?app=onlyoffice) [![Integration level](https://dash.yunohost.org/integration/onlyoffice.svg)](https://dash.yunohost.org/appci/app/onlyoffice)

ONLYOFFICE Server is a free collaborative online office suite comprising viewers and editors for texts, spreadsheets and presentations, fully compatible with Office Open XML formats: .docx, .xlsx, .pptx and enabling collaborative editing in real time.

## Connect OnlyOffice Server with Nextcloud

1. Install [OnlyOffice Server](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/onlyoffice_ynh) in a different domain than the one used by Nextcloud: `https://onlyoffice.domain.org` and `https://domain.org/nextcloud` (for example)

2. Install [ONLYOFFICE connector](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/onlyoffice) in Nextcloud
- Connect to Nextcloud as admin and install ONLYOFFICE Connector: -> Applications -> install ONLYOFFICE. (ONLYOFFICE Connector doesn't need to match your OnlyOffice Server version number).
- In Settings (`https://domain.org/nextcloud/settings/admin/onlyoffice`), enter your OnlyOffice Server address (for example: `https://onlyoffice.domain.org`)

OnlyOffice Server is now connected to Nextcloud.
