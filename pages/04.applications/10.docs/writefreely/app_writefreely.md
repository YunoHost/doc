**WriteFreely** is a clean, minimalist publishing platform made for writers. Start a blog, share knowledge within your organization, or build a community around the shared act of writing.

## Features:
### Made for writing

Built on a plain, auto-saving editor, WriteFreely gives you a distraction-free writing environment. Once published, your words are front and center, and easy to read.

### A connected community

Start writing together, publicly or privately. Connect with other communities, whether running WriteFreely, [Plume](https://yunohost.org/en/app_plume), or other ActivityPub-powered software. And bring members on board from your existing platforms, thanks to our OAuth 2.0 support.

### Intuitive organization

Categorize articles [with hashtags](https://writefreely.org/docs/latest/writer/hashtags), and create static pages from normal posts by [_pinning_ them](https://writefreely.org/docs/latest/writer/static) to your blog. Create draft posts and publish to multiple blogs from one account.

### International

Blog elements are localized in 20+ languages, and WriteFreely includes first-class support for non-Latin and right-to-left (RTL) script languages.

### Private by default

WriteFreely collects minimal data, and never publicizes more than a writer consents to. Writers can seamlessly create multiple blogs from a single account for different pen names or purposes without publicly revealing their association.
