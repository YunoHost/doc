[![Install Discourse with YunoHost](https://install-app.yunohost.org/install-with-yunohost.png)](https://install-app.yunohost.org/?app=discourse) [![Integration level](https://dash.yunohost.org/integration/discourse.svg)](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/jenkins/job/discourse%20%28Community%29/lastBuild/consoleFull)

Discourse has all the usual features of a discussion forum: users, discussions, search, private messages, etc. The "mailing list" mode allows you to use most of the forum's functionalities via e-mail. Written in Ruby and JavaScript, it requires a PostgreSQL database and a mail server.[ยน](#sources)

## Limitations with YunoHost

In the administration dashboard, The installed version is shown as unknown (due the fact that we don't use Git for installation); you can safely ignore that as the YunoHost package will be maintained. On ARM devices, default generated avatars are missing the profile initials (they are only a plain discus).
