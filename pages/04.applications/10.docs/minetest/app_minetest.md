A game of cubes in an unlimited space where picks and shovels are de rigueur to build imaginary constructions, dig tunnels, walk in the sandstone of his wishes, make encounters, pick up a few flowers here and there, swimming...
Minetest is the equivalent of Minecraft with the addition of free gameplay and the possibility of integrating a development team to improve the product.
Minetest is also a server that allows you to welcome your friends or just a few curious visitors or even experienced players.
