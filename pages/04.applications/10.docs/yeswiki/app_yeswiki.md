[![Installer YesWiki with YunoHost](https://install-app.yunohost.org/install-with-yunohost.svg)](https://install-app.yunohost.org/?app=yeswiki) [![Integration level](https://dash.yunohost.org/integration/yeswiki.svg)](https://dash.yunohost.org/appci/app/yeswiki)

*YesWiki* is a wiki designed to remain simple, very easy to install, in French translated into English, Spanish, Catalan, Flemish...

However, with a YesWiki we can build a website with multiple uses:
- Gather all the information of a project or a group (function of "central station")
- Mapping members or places in a participatory way
- Share resources, lists, calendars thanks to powerful cooperative databases
- Communicate information flows
- Cultivate a bit of freedom...

### Disclaimers / important information

##### Multi-users support

LDAP integration is supported and required on new installs. It is possible to disable it on older installs by removing the loginldap plugin. **Warning: only do it if you know credentials for a wiki admin account**

At the moment SSO authentication is not supported. It is necessary to login on the wiki.
