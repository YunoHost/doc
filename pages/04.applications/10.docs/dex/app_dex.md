[![Install Dex with YunoHost](https://install-app.yunohost.org/install-with-yunohost.png)](https://install-app.yunohost.org/?app=dex) [![Integration level](https://dash.yunohost.org/integration/dex.svg)](https://dash.yunohost.org/appci/app/dex)

Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID Connect to drive authentication for other apps. This YunoHost package will install Dex and setup a canonical OpenID Connect provider for your YunoHost instance, based on the LDAP user base, that can then be used as an authentification server for other YunoHost apps.
