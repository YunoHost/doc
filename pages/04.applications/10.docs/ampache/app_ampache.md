[![Install Ampache with YunoHost](https://install-app.yunohost.org/install-with-yunohost.png)](https://install-app.yunohost.org/?app=ampache) [![Integration level](https://dash.yunohost.org/integration/ampache.svg)](https://dash.yunohost.org/appci/app/ampache)

Ampache is libre audio streaming software.

## Limitations with YunoHost

Since SSO authentication does not work entirely from the user panel, we need to work on it. In fact, this can be disruptive to external Ampache clients such as Subsonic.
