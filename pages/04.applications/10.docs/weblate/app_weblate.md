Weblate is a web-based translation tool strongly linked to version control systems. Through a clear and simple user interface, Weblate allows the propagation of translations between sub-projects, can check the
quality of the translations and is automatically linked to the source files.
Weblate works very well with a GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket server. It is possible to import already existing translations of a project, allowing everyone to contribute to the translation of a project via its web interface,
and then push the translations to the repository.
There is a system for reviewing, suggesting, commenting on a translation.
You can install a third party authentication, for example you can log in with your GitHub account. Our account then allows us to keep a history.
