### Updating the application

It is at this new step, where the fields are pre-filled, that you will have to fill in the database password.

You will be able to find it by connecting to your server with SSH. You will have to switch to `root` and display the `config.inc.php` file in which the application password is located:

```

cat /var/www/galette/galette/config/config.inc.php
```
