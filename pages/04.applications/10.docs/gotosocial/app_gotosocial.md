## Docs of the GoToSocial's package for YunoHost

### Administration

You can login with your admin user (the one automatically created during installation) to your-instance.com/**admin** to administrate your GoToSocial instance.  
[The source code of this administration panel](https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial-admin) is available on github.  
[The GTS admin panel documentation](https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/admin/settings/).

In this administration interface, you can configure the following things:

* The name of your instance and its description
* Your contact e-mail address
* The referring user
* Blocked domains (not to federate with) or allowed domains (for the allowlist federation mode)
* Custom emojis
* Moderation reports

### Configuration

You can configure your instance using the config panel integrated in Yunohost, you will find it in the web admin interface of your Yunohost by following these steps:  
`Applications > GoToSocial > Config Panel`

In this control panel you can configure the following things (non-exhaustive list):

* Account configuration :
  * Are registrations open?
  * Manual validation of registrations?
  * Required reason for registration?
  * Allow user custom CSS?
  * Custom CSS max length?
* Media configuration
  * Maximum image size
  * Maximum video size
  * Minimum number of characters for media descriptions
  * Maximum number of characters for media descriptions
  * Number of days media can be cached
* Post configuration
  * Maximum number of characters for a new post
  * Maximum number of characters in a Content Warning / subject of a new post
  * Maximum number of options for a poll
  * Maximum number of characters for a poll option
  * Maximum number of media that can be added to a post
* Instance config
  * Federation mode to use for this instance (blocklist / allowlist)
  * Landing page user
  * Exposed API options
* SMTP config
* Cache settings
* Advanced settings
  * SameSite attribute
  * Rate limit

Note: **Do NOT edit** the `config.yaml` file by hand. Always use this config panel instead. Otherwise your changes will be deleted at each update!

### Command line (CLI)

To use the GoToSocial command line, you first need to place yourself in the folder of your instance:  
`cd /var/www/gotosocial/` or `cd /var/www/gotosocial__x/` (where `x` is the installation number of your instance, in the case of multi-installation).  
Feel free to refer to the [GoToSocial command line documentation](https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/admin/cli/).

### User creation

To create a new user, proceed as follows:

```bash
./gotosocial --config-path config.yaml admin account create --username some_username --email someuser@example.com --password 'SomeLongAndComplicatedPassword'
```

And to promote them as an administrator of your instance:

```bash
./gotosocial --config-path config.yaml admin account promote --username some_username
```

### OpenID Connect

You can read the [official GoToSocial documentation about OpenID Connect](https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/configuration/oidc/) in support if you want.

To use OpenID Connect, the YunoHost admin must:

* Install the [Dex](https://apps.yunohost.org/app/dex) package (note that your server must compile it, which can be resource-intensive)
* Configure Dex properly during the installation (all entered information will be used in the next step, so keep it in a safe place)
  * Domain: as you wish (may be a sub-domain of your GTS instance, like "dex.gts.example.com")
  * Path: only `/` if you wish to install it on a sub-domain of your instance, otherwise as you wish
  * Name of the app: "GoToSocial", "GTS-test", "YNH-GoToSocial" or anything that makes sense to you and does not contain a space (it will be used as "client ID" in the next step)
  * OIDC secret: a long and random password of at least 30 characters
  * Callback URI: `gts.example.com/auth/callback` by replacing the `gts.example.com` by the domain name of your GTS instance (without the `https://`!)
* Configure GTS using the config panel's OIDC form: `Applications > GoToSocial > Config Panel > OpenID Connect settings`
  * Activate OpenID Connect: `true`
  * Name of the OIDC IDP: "Dex" or any other name that makes sense
  * Skip the normal verification flow of tokens returned: keep on `false` ( **never** change to `true` unless you know what you're doing!)
  * OIDC issuer URI: the domain name to which you assigned Dex in the previous step, with the final slash `/`, e.g. `https://dex.gts.example.com/` (this is **NOT** the URL of your GTS instance)
  * OIDC client ID: the app name defined at the Dex installation step (e.g. "GoToSocial", "GTS-test", "YNH-GoToSocial")
  * OIDC client secret: the long password randomly generated during Dex's installation step
  * Save, wait until GTS reboots and test!
