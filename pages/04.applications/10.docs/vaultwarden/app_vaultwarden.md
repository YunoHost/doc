Vaultwarden is a freemium libre password manager under AGPL license, allowing generation and storage of passwords in a secure way. These are protected by a single password called the "master password". It was created in 2016 by Kyle Spearrin, a software architect.

The software is available for most operating systems (GNU/Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android and command-line), and as a web browser plug-in. It is also possible to view passwords from a website.[¹](#sources)

## Configuration
