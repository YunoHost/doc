[![Install Wallabag2 with YunoHost](https://install-app.yunohost.org/install-with-yunohost.png)](https://install-app.yunohost.org/?app=wallabag2) [![Integration level](https://dash.yunohost.org/integration/wallabag2.svg)](https://dash.yunohost.org/appci/app/wallabag2)

Wallabag is a self hostable Read-It-Later application allowing you to not miss any content anymore. Click, save, read it when you can.
It extracts content so that you can read it when you have time.

### Features

In addition to Wallabag core features, the following are made available with this package:

 * Integrate with YunoHost users and SSO - i.e. logout button
 * Allow one user to be the administrator (set at the installation)
 * Asynchronous import using Redis (need to be enabled in the *Internal Settings*). RabbitMQ import not supported (yet ?)

### Upgrade from v1.x

No automatic upgrade process is available. You need a manual (but simple) migration from Wallabag v1.
Please take a look at the [official documentation](https://doc.wallabag.org/en/user/import/wallabagv1.html).
