Plume is a decentralized and federated blog engine under development.

* Decentralized: Each instance can follow one or more other Plume instances in order to allow its rice-users to view their videos.
* Federated: Via the ActivityPub protocol, Plume can interact with other software that are part of the Fediverse, such as Mastodon or PixelFed for example.
