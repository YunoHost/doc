[![Install Plume with YunoHost](https://install-app.yunohost.org/install-with-yunohost.png)](https://install-app.yunohost.org/?app=plume) [![Integration level](https://dash.yunohost.org/integration/plume.svg)](https://dash.yunohost.org/appci/app/plume)

Plume is a decentralized and federated blog engine under development.

* Decentralized: Each instance can follow one or more other Plume instances in order to allow its rice-users to view their videos.
* Federated: Via the ActivityPub protocol, Plume can interact with other software that are part of the Fediverse, such as Mastodon or PixelFed for example.
