Moodle is a Learning Management System (LMS) for creating, sharing and animating learning and training resources.
At least it can be used to share course materials (in different formats), but above all, it allows the creation of rich learning activities focusing on interactions between users (learners like trainers).
It integrates about ten activities (quiz, lesson, forum, wiki, homework, survey, self-assessment workshop between peers...) and resource formats (pdf, text, audio-visual, image, scorm...) by default that can be enriched by modules
complementary (in particular to propose specific activities in certain areas).
