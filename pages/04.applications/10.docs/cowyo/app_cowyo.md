[![Install cowyo with YunoHost](https://install-app.yunohost.org/install-with-yunohost.png)](https://install-app.yunohost.org/?app=cowyo) [![Integration level](https://dash.yunohost.org/integration/cowyo.svg)](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/ci/apps/cowyo/)

Cowyo is a self-contained wiki server that makes jotting notes easy and fast. The most important feature here is simplicity. Other features include versioning, page locking, self-destructing messages, encryption, and listifying.

## Limitations with YunoHost

By design, cowyo requires its own domain. He does not support multiple users.
