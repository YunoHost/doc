Dotclear is an open-source blog publishing application distributed under the GNU GPLv2. Developed originally by Olivier Meunier from 2002, Dotclear has now attracted a solid team of developers. It is relatively popular in French speaking countries, where it is used by several major blogging platforms (Gandi Blogs, Marine nationale, etc.).

Dotclear's proposed aim is to develop a software that fully respects web standards based on open source solutions, with multilingual interface and publishing capabilities. It is written in PHP. [¹](#sources)
