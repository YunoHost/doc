## Glossary

You may encounter some named types which are used for simplicity.

- `Translation`: a translated property
    - used for properties: `ask`, `help` and `Pattern.error`
    - a `dict` with locales as keys and translations as values:
        ```toml
        ask.en = "The text in english"
        ask.fr = "Le texte en français"
        ```
        It is not currently possible for translators to translate those string in weblate.
    - a single `str` for a single english default string
        ```toml
        help = "The text in english"
        ```
- `JSExpression`: a `str` JS expression to be evaluated to `true` or `false`:
    - used for properties: `visible` and `enabled`
    - operators availables: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!`, `&&`, `||`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` and `match()`
- `Binding`: bind a value to a file/property/variable/getter/setter/validator
    - save the value in `settings.yaml` when not defined
    - nothing at all with `"null"`
    - a custom getter/setter/validator with `"null"` + a function starting with `get__`, `set__`, `validate__` in `scripts/config`
    - a variable/property in a file with `:__FINALPATH__/my_file.php`
    - a whole file with `__FINALPATH__/my_file.php`
- `Pattern`: a `dict` with a regex to match the value against and an error message
    ```toml
    pattern.regexp = '^[A-F]\d\d$'
    pattern.error = "Provide a room number such as F12: one uppercase and 2 numbers"
    # or with translated error
    pattern.error.en = "Provide a room number such as F12: one uppercase and 2 numbers"
    pattern.error.fr = "Entrez un numéro de salle comme F12: une lettre majuscule et deux chiffres."
    ```
    - IMPORTANT: your `pattern.regexp` should be between simple quote, not double.


## Configuration panel structure

### ConfigPanel

This is the 'root' level of the config panel toml file

#### Examples

```toml
version = 1.0

[config]
# …refer to Panels doc
```

#### Properties

- `version`: `float` (default: `1.0`), version that the config panel supports in terms of features.
- `i18n` (optional): `str`, an i18n property that let you internationalize options text.
    - However this feature is only available in core configuration panel (like `yunohost domain config`), prefer the use `Translation` in `name`, `help`, etc.

---

### Panel

Panels are, basically, sections grouped together. Panels are `dict`s defined inside a ConfigPanel file and require a unique id (in the below example, the id is `main`). Keep in mind that this id will be used in CLI to refer to the panel, so choose something short and meaningfull.

#### Examples
```toml
[main]
name.en = "Main configuration"
name.fr = "Configuration principale"
help = ""
services = ["__APP__", "nginx"]

    [main.customization]
    # …refer to Sections doc
```
#### Properties
- `name`: `Translation` or `str`, displayed as the panel title
- `help` (optional): `Translation` or `str`, text to display before the first section
- `services` (optional): `list` of services names to `reload-or-restart` when any option's value contained in the panel changes
    - `"__APP__` will refer to the app instance name
- `actions`: FIXME not sure what this does

---

### Section

Sections are, basically, options grouped together. Sections are `dict`s defined inside a Panel and require a unique id (in the below example, the id is `customization` prepended by the panel's id `main`). Keep in mind that this combined id will be used in CLI to refer to the section, so choose something short and meaningfull. Also make sure to not make a typo in the panel id, which would implicitly create an other entire panel.

If at least one `button` is present it then become an action section.
Options in action sections are not considered settings and therefor are not saved, they are more like parameters that exists only during the execution of an action.
FIXME i'm not sure we have this in code.

#### Examples
```toml
[main]

    [main.customization]
    name.en = "Advanced configuration"
    name.fr = "Configuration avancée"
    help = "Every form items in this section are not saved."
    services = ["__APP__", "nginx"]

        [main.customization.option_id]
        type = "string"
        # …refer to Options doc
```

#### Properties
- `name` (optional): `Translation` or `str`, displayed as the section's title if any
- `help`: `Translation` or `str`, text to display before the first option
- `services` (optional): `list` of services names to `reload-or-restart` when any option's value contained in the section changes
    - `"__APP__` will refer to the app instance name
- `optional`: `bool` (default: `true`), set the default `optional` prop of all Options in the section
- `visible`: `bool` or `JSExpression` (default: `true`), allow to conditionally display a section depending on user's answers to previous questions.
    - Be careful that the `visible` property should only refer to **previous** options's value. Hence, it should not make sense to have a `visible` property on the very first section.

---
## List of all option types

### Common properties

Options are fields declaration that renders as form items, button, alert or text in the web-admin and printed or prompted in CLI.
They are used in app manifests to declare the before installation form and in config panels.

[Have a look at the app config panel doc](/packaging_apps_config_panels) for details about Panels and Sections.

! IMPORTANT: as for Panels and Sections you have to choose an id, but this one should be unique in all this document, even if the question is in an other panel.

#### Example

```toml
[section.my_option_id]
type = "string"
# ask as `str`
ask = "The text in english"
# ask as `dict`
ask.en = "The text in english"
ask.fr = "Le texte en français"
# advanced props
visible = "my_other_option_id != 'success'"
readonly = true
# much advanced: config panel only?
bind = "null"
```

#### Properties

- `type`: the actual type of the option, such as 'markdown', 'password', 'number', 'email', ...
- `ask`: `Translation` (default to the option's `id` if not defined):
    - text to display as the option's label for inputs or text to display for readonly options
    - in config panels, questions are displayed on the left side and therefore have not much space to be rendered. Therefore, it is better to use a short question, and use the `help` property to provide additional details if necessary.
- `visible` (optional): `bool` or `JSExpression` (default: `true`)
    - define if the option is diplayed/asked
    - if `false` and used alongside `readonly = true`, you get a context only value that can still be used in `JSExpression`s
- `readonly` (optional): `bool` (default: `false`, forced to `true` for readonly types):
    - If `true` for input types: forbid mutation of its value
- `bind` (optional): `Binding`, config panels only! A powerful feature that let you configure how and where the setting will be read, validated and written
    - if not specified, the value will be read/written in the app `settings.yml`
    - if `"null"`:
        - the value will not be stored at all (can still be used in context evaluations)
        - if in `scripts/config` there's a function named:
            - `get__my_option_id`: the value will be gathered from this custom getter
            - `set__my_option_id`: the value will be passed to this custom setter where you can do whatever you want with the value
            - `validate__my_option_id`: the value will be passed to this custom validator before any custom setter
    - if `bind` is a file path:
        - if the path starts with `:`, the value be saved as its id's variable/property counterpart
            - this only works for first level variables/properties and simple types (no array)
        - else the value will be stored as the whole content of the file
        - you can use `__FINALPATH__` or `__INSTALL_DIR__` in your path to point to dynamic install paths
            - FIXME are other global variables accessible?
    - [refer to `bind` doc for explaination and examples](#read-and-write-values-the)

---

### Common inputs properties

Rest of the option types available are considered `inputs`.

#### Example

```toml
[section.my_option_id]
type = "string"
# …any common props… +
optional = false
redact = false
default = "some default string"
help = "You can enter almost anything!"
example = "an example string"
placeholder = "write something…"
```

#### Properties

- [common properties](#common-properties)
- `optional`: `bool` (default: `false`, but `true` in config panels)
- `redact`: `bool` (default: `false`), to redact the value in the logs when the value contain private information
- `default`: depends on `type`, the default value to assign to the option
    - in case of readonly values, you can use this `default` to assign a value (or return a dynamic `default` from a custom getter)
- `help` (optional): `Translation`, to display a short help message in cli and web-admin
- `example` (optional): `str`, to display an example value in web-admin only
- `placeholder` (optional): `str`, shown in the web-admin fields only

---

### `markdown` (readonly)

Display markdown multi-line content.
Markdown is currently only rendered in the web-admin

#### Example
```toml
[section.my_option_id]
type = "display_text"
ask = "Text **rendered** in markdown."
```
#### Properties

- [common properties](#common-properties)

---

### `alert` (readonly)

Alerts displays a important message with a level of severity.
You can use markdown in `ask` but will only be rendered in the web-admin.

#### Example

```toml
[section.my_option_id]
type = "alert"
ask = "The configuration seems to be manually modified..."
style = "warning"
icon = "warning"
```
#### Properties

- [common properties](#common-properties)
- `style`: any of `"success|info|warning|danger"` (default: `"info"`)
- `icon` (optional): any icon name from [Fork Awesome](https://forkaweso.me/Fork-Awesome/icons/)
    - Currently only displayed in the web-admin

---

### `button` (readonly)

Triggers actions.
Available only in config panels.
Renders as a `button` in the web-admin and can be called with `yunohost [app|domain|settings] action run <action_id>` in CLI.

Every options defined in an action section (a config panel section with at least one `button`) is guaranted to be shown/asked to the user and available in `scripts/config`'s scope.
[check examples in advanced use cases](#actions).

#### Example

```toml
[section.my_option_id]
type = "button"
ask = "Break the system"
style = "danger"
icon = "bug"
# enabled only if another option's value (a `boolean` for example) is positive
enabled = "aknowledged"
```

To be able to trigger an action we have to add a bash function starting with `run__` in your `scripts/config`

```bash
run__my_action_id() {
    ynh_print_info "Running 'my_action_id' action"
}
```

#### Properties

- [common properties](#common-properties)
    - `bind`: forced to `"null"`
- `style`: any of `"success|info|warning|danger"` (default: `"success"`)
- `enabled`: `JSExpression` or `bool` (default: `true`)
    - when used with `JSExpression` you can enable/disable the button depending on context
