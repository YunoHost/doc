## Users / Administrators documentation pages

Add a one-click install button (such as <https://yunohost.org/app_piwigo>) and a button on the application integration level.

Classification of available applications by tags (genre, Git, association management, e-mails, etc.).

## Some typical and general uses (writing framework)

- rename the images in the following order:`description_application.ext`.

## Roadmap

1. Document applications.
   1. Document applications at work (marked: work) level 8/7/6.
   2. Translate the documentation page at least into French and English.
   3. Do a PR on the application repository
