In YunoHost application developpement there are several places where you end up
writting questions for your user like in the `manifest.json/toml`, the
`config_panel.json/toml` or `actions.json/toml`.

This page documents this format and all available kind of questions you can ask
your user. Unless it's stated otherwise, this format applies to everyplace it's
usable (for now: installation arguments in `manifest.json/toml`,
`config_panel.json/toml` and `actions.json/toml`)

## YunoHost arguments general format

The general format for an argument looks like this in toml:

```toml
[maybe.some.stuff.before.the_name]
type = "one_of_the_available_type"
ask.en = "the question in english"
ask.fr = "the question in french"
help.en = "some help text in english" # optional
help.fr = "some help text in french" # optional
example = "an example value" # optional
default = "some stuff" # optional, not available for all types
optional = true # optional, will skip if not answered
```

And in json:

```javascript
{
    "name": "the_name",
    "type": "one_of_the_available_type",  // "sting" is not specified
    "ask": {
        "en": "the question in english",
        "fr": "the question in french"
    },
    "help": {
        "en": "some help text in english",
        "fr": "some help text in french"
    },
    "example": "an example value", // optional
    "default", "some stuff", // optional, not available for all types
    "optional": true // optional, will skip if not answered
},
```

## All avaiable types

},
```
