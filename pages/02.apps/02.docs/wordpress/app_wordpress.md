WordPress is a free, open-source, open source content management system (CMS). This software written in PHP is based on a MySQL database and is distributed by the American company Automattic. WordPress' functionalities allow it to create and manage different types of websites: showcase site, online store site, application site, blog, or portfolio. It is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL version 2 license.[¹](#sources)

## Limitations with YunoHost

Multisite is only available on subdirectories.

As the auto-update plugin does not work as expected, be careful to keep wordpress up to date from the WordPress admin panel, not just from the YunoHost admin panel. For security reasons, make sure that all updates are regularly applied in the WordPress Control Panel as well as in the YunoHost Control Panel.
