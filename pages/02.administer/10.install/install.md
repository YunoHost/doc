! N.B. : Installing YunoHost in a VirtualBox is usually intended for testing or development. It is not convenient to run an actual server on the long-term, because the machine it's installed on probably won't be up 24/7, and because Virtualbox adds an additional layer of complexity in exposing the machine to the Internet.
{% endif %}

{% if wsl %}
## Introduction
WSL is a nice feature of Windows 10, making Linux pseudo-distributions available through command line. Let's say pseudo, because even though they are not really like virtual machines, they rely on virtualization capacities that make their integration with Windows almost seamless.
Docker for Windows can now rely on WSL instead of Hyper-V, for example.

! Bear in mind, this setup itself is *not* a container of any kind. If something breaks, there is no rollback capability.
! You may need to delete the Debian distro altogether and restore it whole.

## Install Debian 11

Let's install YunoHost into its own distro, not altering the default one. In a PowerShell terminal:

```bash
# Let's go in your home directory and prepare the working directories
cd ~
mkdir -p WSL\YunoHost
# Download the Debian appx package and unzip it
curl.exe -L -o debian.zip https://aka.ms/wsl-debian-gnulinux
Expand-Archive .\debian.zip -DestinationPath .\debian
# Import the Debian base into a new distro
wsl --import YunoHost ~\WSL\YunoHost ~\debian\install.tar.gz --version 2
# Cleanup
rmdir .\debian -R
```

You can now access it: run `wsl.exe -d YunoHost`

It is under Debian 9 Stretch, so let's upgrade it: 

```bash
# In WSL
sudo sed -i 's/stretch/bullseye/g' /etc/apt/sources.list`
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt dist-upgrade
```
## Prevent WSL from tweaking configuration files

Edit `/etc/wsl.conf` and put the following code in it:

```
[network]
generateHosts = false
generateResolvConf = false
```

## Force the use of iptables-legacy

Somehow the YunoHost post-installation does not like `nf_tables`, the new software replacing `iptables`.
We can still explicitely use the good ol' `iptables` though:

```bash
# In WSL
sudo update-alternatives --set iptables /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy
sudo update-alternatives --set ip6tables /usr/sbin/ip6tables-legacy
```

## Install Systemd

Debian on WSL does not have `systemd`, a service configuration software.
This is a key element for YunoHost, and for any decent Debian distro (seriously MS, what the heck). Let's install it:

1. Install dotNET runtime:
```bash
# In WSL
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/debian/11/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y dotnet-sdk-3.1
```

2. Install [Genie](https://github.com/arkane-systems/genie):
```bash
# In WSL
# Add their repository
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://wsl-translinux.arkane-systems.net/apt/ /" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wsl-translinux.list
# Install Genie
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y systemd-genie
```

## Install YunoHost

```bash
# In WSL
# Let's switch to the root user, if you were not already
sudo su
# Initialize the Genie bottle to have systemd running
genie -s
# Your hostname should have been appended with "-wsl"
# Install YunoHost
curl https://install.yunohost.org | bash -s -- -a
```

### Access the command line

Always call `genie -s` while starting your distro.

`wsl -d YunoHost -e genie -s`

## Backup and restore the distro 
### Make your first distro backup
As said before, there is no rollback capability. So let's export your fresh distro. In PowerShell:

```
cd ~
wsl --export YunoHost .\WSL\YunoHost.tar.gz
```

### In case of crash, delete and restore the whole distro

```
cd ~
wsl --unregister YunoHost
wsl --import YunoHost .\WSL\YunoHost .\WSL\YunoHost.tar.gz --version 2
```
{% endif %}

## Create a new virtual machine

![](image://virtualbox_1.png?class=inline)

! It's okay if you can only have 32-bit versions, just be sure that you downloaded the 32-bit image previously.

## Tweak network settings

! This step is important to properly expose the virtual machine on the network

Go to **Settings** > **Network**:

* Select `Bridged adapter`
* Select your interface's name:
    **wlan0** if you are connected wirelessly, or **eth0** otherwise.

![](image://virtualbox_2.png?class=inline)

{% endif %}









{% if arm %}
## [fa=plug /] Power up the board

* Plug the ethernet cable (one side on your main router, the other on your board).
    * For advanced users willing to configure the board to connect to WiFi instead, see for example [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md).
* Plug the SD card in your board
* (Optional) You can connect a screen+keyboard directly on your board if you want to troubleshoot the boot process or if you're more comfortable to "see what happens" or want a direct access to the board.
* Power up the board
* Wait a couple minutes while the board autoconfigure itself during the first boot
* Make sure that your computer (desktop/laptop) is connected to the same local network (i.e. same internet box) as your server.

{% elseif virtualbox %}
## [fa=plug /] Boot up the virtual machine

Start the virtual machine after selecting the YunoHost image.

![](image://virtualbox_2.1.png?class=inline)

! If you encounter the error "VT-x is not available", you probably need to enable Virtualization in the BIOS of your computer.


{% else %}
## [fa=plug /] Boot the machine on your USB stick

* Plug the ethernet cable (one side on your main router, the other on your server).
* Boot up your server with the USB stick or a CD-ROM inserted, and select it as **bootable device** by pressing one of the following keys (hardware specific):
`<ESC>`, `<F9>`, `<F10>`, `<F11>`, `<F12>` or `<DEL>`.
    * N.B. : if the server was previously installed with a recent version of Windows (8+), you first need to tell Windows, to "actually reboot". This can be done somewhere in "Advanced startup options".

## [fa=rocket /] Launch the graphical install

[/figure]
[ui-tabs position="top-left" active="0" theme="lite"]

[ui-tab title="Installation classique sur un disque entier"]

!! N.B.: Once you have validated the keyboard layout, the installation will be launched and will completely erase the data on your hard disk!

  1. Select `Graphical install`
  2. Select your language, your location, your keyboard layout, and eventually your timezone.
  3. The installer will then download and install all required packages.

[/ui-tab]
[ui-tab title="Installation in expert mode"]

The YunoHost project simplified the classic installation as much as possible in order to avoid as many people as possible being lost with questions that are too technical or related to specific cases.

With the expert mode installation, you have more possibilities, especially concerning the exact partitioning of your storage media. You can also decide to use the classic mode and [add your disks afterwards](/external_storage). 

### Summary of the steps in expert mode:
  1. Select `Expert graphical install`.
  2. Select your language, location, keyboard layout and possibly your timezone.
  3. Partition your disks. This is where you can set up a RAID or encrypt all or part of the server.
  4. Specify a possible HTTP proxy to use for the installation of the packages
  5. Specify on which volumes grub should be installed

### Regarding partitioning

In general, we recommend against partitioning `/var`, `/opt`, `/usr`, `/bin`, `/etc`, `/lib`, `/tmp` and `/root` on separate partitions. This will prevent you from having to worry about full partitions that could crash your machine, cause app installations to fail, or even corrupt your databases.

For performance reasons, it is recommended to mount your fastest storage (SSD) on the root `/`.

If you have one or more hard drives to store data, you can choose to mount it on one of these folders depending on your usage.

| Path | Contents |
|--------|---|
| `/home` | User folders accessible via SFTP |
| `/home/yunohost.backup/archives` | YunoHost backups to be placed ideally elsewhere than on the disks that manage the data |
| `/home/yunohost.app` | Heavy data from YunoHost applications (nextcloud, matrix...) |
| `/home/yunohost.multimedia` | Heavy data shared between several applications |
| `/var/mail` | User mail

If you want flexibility and don't want to (re)size partitions, you can also choose to mount on `/mnt/hdd` and follow this [tutorial to mount all these folders with `mount --bind`](/external_storage).

### About encryption
Be aware that if you encrypt all or part of your disks, you will have to type the passphrase every time you restart your server, which can be a problem if you are not on site. There are however solutions (quite difficult to implement) that allow you to type the passphrase via SSH or via a web page (search for "dropbear encrypted disk").

### About RAID
Keep in mind that:
 * the disks in your RAIDs must be of different brands, wear and tear or batches (especially if they are SSDs)
 * a RAID 1 (even without a spare) is more reliable than a RAID 5 from a probability point of view
 * hardware raids are dependent on the raid card, if the card fails you will need a replacement to read and rebuild the array

## [fa=bug /] Connect to the board and hotfix the image
Raspberry Pi 1 and 0 are not totally supported due to [compilation issues for this architecture](https://github.com/YunoHost/issues/issues/1423).

However, it is possible to fix by yourself the image before to run the initial configuration.

To achieve this, you need to connect on your raspberry pi as root user [via SSH](/ssh) with the temporary password `yunohost`:
```
ssh root@yunohost.local
```
(or `yunohost-2.local`, and so on if multiple YunoHost servers are on your network)

Then run the following commands to work around the metronome issue:
```
mv /usr/bin/metronome{,.bkp}   
mv /usr/bin/metronomectl{,.bkp} 
ln -s /usr/bin/true /usr/bin/metronome
ln -s /usr/bin/true /usr/bin/metronomectl
```

And this one to work around the upnpc issue:
```
sed -i 's/import miniupnpc/#import miniupnpc/g' /usr/lib/moulinette/yunohost/firewall.py
```

! This last command need to be run after each yunohost upgrade :/

{% elseif arm_unsup %}
## [fa=terminal /] Connect to the board

Next you need to [find the local IP address of your server](/finding_the_local_ip) to connect as root user [via SSH](/ssh) with the temporary password `1234`.

```
ssh root@192.168.x.xxx
```

## [fa=rocket /] Run the install script

- Open a command line prompt on your server (either directly or [through SSH](/ssh))
- Make sure you are root (or type `sudo -i` to become root)
- Run the following command:

```bash
curl https://install.yunohost.org | bash
```

!!! If `curl` is not installed on your system, you might need to install it with `apt install curl`.
!!! Otherwise, if the command does not do anything, you might want to `apt install ca-certificates`

!!! **Note for advanced users concerned with the `curl|bash` approach:** consider reading ["Is curl|bash insecure?"](https://sandstorm.io/news/2015-09-24-is-curl-bash-insecure-pgp-verified-install) on Sandstom's blog, and possibly [this discussion on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12766350&noprocess).

{% endif %}

## [fa=cog /] Proceed with the initial configuration

!!! If you are in the process of restoring a server using a YunoHost backup, you should skip this step and instead [restore the backup instead of the postinstall step](/backup#restoring-during-the-postinstall).

[ui-tabs position="top-left" active="0" theme="lite"]
[ui-tab title="From the web interface"]
{%if at_home %}
In an internet browser, type **{% if internetcube %}`https://internetcube.local`{% else %}`https://yunohost.local` (or `yunohost-2.local`, and so on if multiple YunoHost servers are on your network){% endif %}**.

!!! If this doesn't work, you can [look for the the local IP address of your server](/finding_the_local_ip). The address typically looks like `192.168.x.y`, and you should therefore type `https://192.168.x.y` in your browser's address bar.
{% else %}
You can perform the initial configuration with the web interface by typing in the address bar of your web browser **the public IP address of your server**. Typically, your VPS provider should have provided you with the IP of the server.
{% endif %}

! During the first visit, you will very likely encounter a security warning related to the certificate used by the server. For now, your server uses a self-signed certificate. {% if not wsl %}You will later be able to add a certificate automatically recognized by web browsers as described in the [certificate documentation](/certificate). {% endif %} For now, you should add a security exception to accept the current certificate. (Though, PLEASE, do not take the habit of blindly accepting this kind of security alert!)

{% if not internetcube %}
You should then land on this page :

![Initial configuration page](image://postinstall_web.png?resize=100%&class=inline)
[/figure]

{% endif %}
[/ui-tab]
[ui-tab title="From the command line"]

You can also perform the postinstallation with the command `yunohost tools postinstall` directly on the server, or [via SSH](/ssh).

{% if not internetcube %}

##### [fa=globe /] Main domain

This will be the domain used by your server's users to access the **authentication portal**. You can later add other domains, and change which one is the main domain if needed.

{% if not wsl %}

* If you're new to self-hosting and do not already have a domain name, we recommend using a **.nohost.me** / **.noho.st** / **.ynh.fr** (e.g. `homersimpson.nohost.me`). Provided that it's not already taken, the domain will be configured automatically and you won't need any further configuration step. Please note that the downside is that you won't have full-control over the DNS configuration.

* If you already own a domain name, you probably want to use it here. You will later need to configure DNS records as explained [here](/dns_config).

!!! Yes, you *have to* configure a domain name. If you don't have any domain name and don't want a **.nohost.me** / **.noho.st** / **.ynh.fr** either, you can set up a dummy domain such as `yolo.test` and tweak your **local** `/etc/hosts` file such that this dummy domain [points to the appropriate IP, as explained here](/dns_local_network).

{% else %}

You will have to choose a fake domain, since it will not be accessible from outside.
For example, `ynh.wsl`. The tricky part is advertising this domain to your host.

Alter your `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` file. You should have a line starting by `::1`, update it or add it if needed to get:

```
::1    ynh.wsl localhost
```

If you want to create subdomains, do not forget to add them in the `hosts` file too:

```
::1    ynh.wsl subdomain.ynh.wsl localhost
```

{% endif %}

##### [fa=key /] First user

[Since YunoHost 11.1](https://forum.yunohost.org/t/yunohost-11-1-release-sortie-de-yunohost-11-1/23378), the first user is now created at this stage. You should pick a username and a reasonably complex password. (We cannot stress enough that the password should be **robust**!) This user will be added to the Admins group, and will therefore be able to access the user portal, the web admin interface, and connect [via **SSH**](/ssh) or [**SFTP**](/filezilla). Admins will also receive emails sent to `root@yourdomain.tld` and `admin@yourdomain.tld` : these emails may be used to send technical informations or alerts. You can later add additional users, which you can also add to the Admins group.

This user replaces the old `admin` user, which some old documentation page may still refer to. In which case : just replace `admin` with your username.


## [fa=stethoscope /] Run the initial diagnosis

Once the postinstall is done, you should be able to actually log in the web admin interface using the credentials of the first user you just created.

{% if wsl %}
! Reminder: YunoHost in WSL will likely not be reachable from outside, and real domains and certificates won't be able to be assigned to it.
{% endif %}
{% if virtualbox %}
! Reminder: YunoHost in VirtualBox will likely not be reachable from outside without further network configuration in Virtualbox's settings. The diagnosis will probably complain about this.
{% endif %}

The diagnosis system is meant to provide an easy way to validate that all critical aspects of your server are properly configured - and guide you in how to fix issues. The diagnosis will run twice a day and send an alert if issues are detected.

!!! N.B. : **don't run away** ! The first time you run the diagnosis, it is quite expected to see a bunch of yellow/red alerts because you typically need to [configure DNS records](/dns_config) (if not using a `.nohost.me`/`noho.st`/`ynh.fr` domain), add a swapfile if not enough ram {% if at_home %} and/or [port forwarding](/isp_box_config){% endif %}.

!!! If an alert is not relevant (for example because you don't intend on using a specific feature), it is perfectly fine to flag the issue as 'ignored' by going in the webadmin > Diagnosis, and clicking the ignore button for this specifc issue.

[ui-tabs position="top-left" active="0" theme="lite"]
[ui-tab title="(Recommended) From the web interface"]
To run a diagnosis, go on Web Admin in the Diagnosis section. Click Run initial diagnosis and you should get a screen like this :

yunohost diagnosis run
yunohost diagnosis show --issues --human-readable
```

[/ui-tabs]

## [fa=lock /] Get a Let's Encrypt certificate

Once you configured DNS records and port forwarding (if needed), you should be able to install a Let's Encrypt certificate. This will get rid of the spooky security warning from earlier for new visitors.

For more detailed instructions, or to lean more about SSL/TLS certificates, see [the corresponding page here](/certificate).

## ![](image://tada.png?resize=32&classes=inline) Congratz!

You now have a pretty well configured server. If you're new to YunoHost, we recommend to have a look at [the guided tour](/overview). You should also be able to [install your favourite applications](/apps). Don't forget to [plan backups](/backup) !
