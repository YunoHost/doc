## Functionality
This application is based on rsync and GPG, it offers:
* backup of data on a remote storage (support for different types of storage)
* data encryption, which allows to store data at a third party

The package also allows you to finely define the frequency and type of data to be backed up and integrates an email alert system in case of backup failure.
