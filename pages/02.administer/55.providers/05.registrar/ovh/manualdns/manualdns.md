Let's see how to properly set the DNS redirections with [OVH](http://www.ovh.com).

Once you bought your domain name, got to the Web Control Panel, and click on you domain name on the left side:

Click on the **DNS Zone** tab, then on **Add an entry**:

Now you need to add the DNS redirections as specified by the [standard DNS zone configuration](/dns_config)

Click on "Change in text format", keep the first four lines:
```bash
$TTL 3600
@	IN SOA dns104.ovh.net. tech.ovh.net. (2020083101 86400 3600 3600000 60)
                         IN NS     dns104.ovh.net.
                         IN NS     ns104.ovh.net.
```
then erase everything below, and replace it with the configuration generated by YunoHost as explained in [this page](/dns_config).


### Dynamic IP

[General tutorial on dynamic IP](/dns_dynamicip).

You should follow this part if you have a dynamic IP.

Find out if your ISP provides you with a dynamic IP address [here](/isp).

Let's create a DynHost id.

Follow [this tutorial](http://blog.developpez.com/brutus/p6316/ubuntu/configurer_dynhost_ovh_avec_ddclient) to install ddclient.
ddclient will take care of telling OVH that the IP has changed. Then OVH will update the IP.

You need to add in the configuration file:
* your login and password DynHost
* your domain name

You should also check out [OVH's guide on DynHost](https://www.ovh.co.uk/g2024.hosting_dynhost).
