This page is meant to guide you in obtaining an API key from OVH in order to configure YunoHost's automatic DNS configuration mecanism

! NB. : **DO NOT share your API tokens with anybody!** A malicious attacker obtaining your tokens could take over your domain, and possibly your server!

1. Go to https://eu.api.ovh.com/createToken/

2. Fill the form with the required informations as shown below:

- Account ID or email address: This is your usual OVH login
- Password: This is your usual OVH password
- Script Name: for example `YunoHost Auto DNS`
- Script description: for example `YunoHost Auto DNS`
- Validity: `Unlimited`
- Rights: use the `+` button to add the following lines
    - `GET` : `/domain/zone/*`
    - `POST` : `/domain/zone/*`
    - `PUT` : `/domain/zone/*`
    - `DELETE` : `/domain/zone/*`
