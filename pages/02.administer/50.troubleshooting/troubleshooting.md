Here are some general advices when encountering issues with your server.

## 0. Don't panic.

Stay calm. Most issues are less worse than newcomers usually think. For the love of God <small>(or your favourite deity / animal / food)</small>, please don't jump into the "reinstallation spiral" thinking reinstalling your server from scratch will magically fix stuff. Reinstalling is a heavy operation and is not a good long-term strategy for fixing problems. You will get tired and won't learn anything.

## 1. Look for similar issues on the forum or bugtrackers.

Search [the forum](https://forum.yunohost.org) for topics similar to the issue you're encountering. If you have issues with a specific app, you may also want to check the corresponding bugtracker of the app, for example [here is the bugtracker for the Wordpress app](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/wordpress_ynh/issues).

## 2. Ask for help

Either on [the forum](https://forum.yunohost.org) or the chat: c.f. [this page](/help)

!!! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE provide basic context! Volunteers can NOT help you if you do not take *five* minutes to describe your context: which kind of hardware, which YunoHost version, what you are trying to do, what you tried, what happened and **the corresponding logs**.
