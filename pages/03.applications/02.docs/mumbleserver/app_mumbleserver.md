Mumble is an efficient and stable Voice over IP software that allows you to create audio rooms for multiple people. It is a VoIP software that allows its users to benefit from very low latency and very high quality while providing excellent sound quality. Mumble also incorporates a visual overlay that discreetly positions itself above the other windows to provide a view of the microphone activation of the people you are talking to.
Here is the 'Murmur' server that you will install on your instance of YunoHost.

It is necessary to use a [Mumble client](https://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/3rd_Party_Applications) to use it for each interlocutor.
