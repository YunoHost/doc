Kresus is a free and open source personal finance manager running on your server. It automatically and daily retrieves all your new banking transactions and allows you to categorize them, study them via
graphs, and budgeting.

* Find all your accounts in one interface and view their balance at a glance!
* Set up simple email alerts on transaction amounts and balances to notify you of important events in your accounts.
* Define your own wording, no more "n°168468"! Sort your transactions by category. Perform complex searches on your transactions, by period, category, amount or date!
* Follow the evolution of your money movements at a glance with the graphs by category, by period and by type of movement (expenses or receipts of money).
