Cowyo is a self-contained wiki server that makes jotting notes easy and fast. The most important feature here is simplicity. Other features include versioning, page locking, self-destructing messages, encryption, and listifying.

## Limitations with YunoHost

By design, cowyo requires its own domain. He does not support multiple users.
