Zerobin is a web service for temporarily storing and sharing plain text in encrypted form without readable storage on the server. The encryption/decryption key is not stored on the server but in the transmitted URL. Thus you can share sensitive information (passwords, access codes, and even a discussion) in a confidential way by communicating to your interlocutors the specific address of your content. Moreover this content has a limited value in time and is destroyed after a customizable delay.
