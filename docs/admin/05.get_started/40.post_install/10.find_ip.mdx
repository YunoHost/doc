On an installation at home, your server should typically be accessible using the `yunohost.local` domain. If for any reason this does not work, you may need to find the *local* IP of your server.

## What is a local IP?

The local IP is the address used to refer to your server inside the local network (typically your home) where multiple devices are connected to a router (your internet box). The local IP typically looks like `192.168.x.y` (or sometimes `10.0.x.y` or `172.16.x.y`)

## How to find it?

Any of these tricks should allow you to find the local IP of your server:

<TabItem value="angryip" label="With AngryIP (Recommended)" default>

You can use the [AngryIP](https://angryip.org/download/) software to achieve that. You can scan these local IP ranges in this order until you find the active IP corresponding to your server:

```
192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.0.255
192.168.1.0 -> 192.168.1.255
192.168.2.0 -> 192.168.255.255
10.0.0.0    -> 10.0.255.255
172.16.0.0  -> 172.31.255.255
```

:::tip
- you can order by ping like on this screenshot to easily see effectively-used IP.
- your server should typically be displayed as listening on port 80 and 443
- in case of doubt, just type `https://192.168.x.y` in your browser to check if it's a YunoHost or not.

<TabItem value="router" label="With your internet router / box">

Connect to your internet box / router interface to list the machines connected.

<TabItem value="arp-scan" label="With arp-scan">

If you're using Linux, you can open a terminal and use `sudo arp-scan --local` to list the IP on your local network (this may also work in Windows);

If the `arp-scan` command displays a confusing number of devices, you can check which ones are open to SSH with `nmap -p 22 192.168.1.0/24` to sort them out (adapt the IP range to your local network)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="direct" label="With a direct access on the server">

Plug a screen on your server, log in and type `hostname --all-ip-address`.

The default credentials (before post-installation!) to log in are:

- login: `root`
- password: `yunohost`

(If you are using a raw Armbian image instead of the pre-installed YunoHost image, the credentials are root / 1234)

## I still can't find my local IP

If you are unable to find your server using any of the previous tricks, maybe your server did not boot correctly:

- Make sure that your server is properly plugged in;
- If you're using an SD card, make sure the connector is not too dusty;
- Plug a screen on your server and try to reboot to check that it's properly booting;
- Make sure that your ethernet cable is working and properly plugged in;
