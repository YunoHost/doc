title: Post-install domain configuration
description: "Add a domain for easier access"

Depending on the domain you picked during post-install you may have a few configuration
steps left.

- If you picked one of YunoHost free domain (`nohost.me`, `noho.st`, `ynh.fr`) everything
  is automatic and you should be good to go.

- If you picked a custom domain option you want to have a look at [DNS Configuration](/admin/domains/dns_configuration).

If you want to change the main domain you picked, have a look at [Domain](/admin/domains).
