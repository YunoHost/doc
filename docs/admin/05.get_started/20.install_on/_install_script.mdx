- Open a command line prompt on your server (either directly or [through SSH](/admin/command_line))
- Make sure you are root (or type `sudo -i` to become root)
- Run the following command:

```bash
curl https://install.yunohost.org | bash
```

:::danger
Always make sure there's an `s` at the end of `https`.
:::

:::warning
You might need to first install `curl` and `ca-certificates` by running:
```bash
apt install curl ca-certificates
```
:::

:::note
**For advanced users concerned with the `curl | bash` approach:** consider reading ["Is curl|bash insecure?"](https://sandstorm.io/news/2015-09-24-is-curl-bash-insecure-pgp-verified-install) on Sandstom's blog, and possibly [this discussion on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12766350&noprocess).
