## <FAIcon icon="fa-list-alt"/> Pre-requisites

- A x86-compatible hardware dedicated to YunoHost with at least 512MB of RAM and 16GB of disk
  - this may be an old laptop, desktop computer, or a proper server machine
- A 1GB+ USB key
- A [reasonable ISP](/admin/get_started/providers/isp/), preferably with good and unlimited upstream bandwidth
- An ethernet cable (RJ-45) to connect your server to your router.
- A computer to read this guide, flash the image and access your server.

## <FAIcon icon="fa-download" /> Download the YunoHost image

:::warning
If your machine is 32 bits, be sure to download the 32-bit image.
:::

:::info
(FIXME: this bit is currently broken...)

Optionally, you can [download the project's public key](https://forge.yunohost.org/keys/yunohost_bookworm.asc) to check the authenticity of the images.

## <FAIcon icon="fa-brands fa-usb"/> Flash the YunoHost image

Flash the image on the USB key or CD/DVD.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="etcher" label="With Etcher (recommended)">

Download <Link to="https://www.balena.io/etcher/" target="_blank">Etcher</Link> for your operating system and install it.

Plug your USB key, select your image and click "Flash"

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="usbimager" label="With USBimager">

Download [USBimager](https://bztsrc.gitlab.io/usbimager/) for your operating system and install it.

Plug your USB key, select your image and click "Write"

![USBimager](/img/softwares/usbimager.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dd" label="With dd">

If you are on GNU/Linux / macOS and know your way around command line, you may also flash your USB stick or SD card with `dd`. You can identify which device corresponds to your USB stick or SD card with `fdisk -l` or `lsblk`. A typical SD card name is something like `/dev/mmcblk0`. BE CAREFUL and make sure you got the right name.

Then run:

```bash
# Replace /dev/mmcblk0 if the name of your device is different...
dd if=/path/to/armbian.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 status=progress ; sync
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ventoy" label="Using Ventoy">

Ventoy will be useful if you can't sucessfully boot the YunoHost image using the other methods.

[Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/) is a nice tool that makes it really easy to put multiple linux images on a USB stick. When the computer refuses to boot from an image on a USB stick, Ventoy will usually be able to boot it anyway!

1. Install [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/) on the USB stick. Refer to the [install instructions](https://www.ventoy.net/en/doc_start.html).
    - This will create 2 partitions on the stick.
2. Using your favorite file explorer app, copy the YunoHost image file on the big `Ventoy` partition (not "VTOYEFI")
    - Don't use *Balena Etcher*, USBImager or `dd` for this!

Later, when you'll boot the computer using this USB stick, Ventoy will appear and will list the images on the USB stick. Select the YunoHost image, then select GRUB2 launch option (or use whichever works for your computer 😉)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## <FAIcon icon="fa-plug"/> Boot the machine on your USB stick

- Connect your computer to your home router via Ethernet
- Boot up your server with the USB stick or a CD-ROM inserted, and select it as **bootable device**.
  - Depending on your hardware, you will need to press one of the following keys:
`<F9>`, `<F10>`, `<F11>`, `<F12>`, `<DEL>`, `<ESC>` or `<Alt>`.
  - N.B. : if the server was previously installed with a recent version of Windows (8+), you first need to tell Windows, to "actually reboot". This can be done somewhere in "Advanced startup options".

:::tip
If you can't boot the YunoHost image, try using Ventoy (select "Ventoy" in the section "Flash the YunoHost image" above).

## <FAIcon icon="fa-rocket"/> Launch the graphical install

You should see a screen like this:

<Figure caption="Preview of the ISO menu" src="/img/softwares/virtualbox_3.png"/>

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="classic" label="Classic installation on a whole disk">

:::danger
Once you have validated the keyboard layout, the installation will be launched and will completely erase the data on your hard disk!
:::

1. Select `Graphical install`
2. Select your language, your location, your keyboard layout, and eventually your timezone.
3. The installer will then download and install all required packages.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="expert" label="Installation in expert mode">

The YunoHost project simplified the classic installation as much as possible in order to avoid as many people as possible being lost with questions that are too technical or related to specific cases.

With the expert mode installation, you have more possibilities, especially concerning the exact partitioning of your storage media. You can also decide to use the classic mode and [add your disks afterwards](/admin/tutorials/external_storage).

### Summary of the steps in expert mode

1. Select `Expert graphical install`.
2. Select your language, location, keyboard layout and possibly your timezone.
3. Partition your disks. This is where you can set up a RAID or encrypt all or part of the server.
4. Specify a possible HTTP proxy to use for the installation of the packages
5. Specify on which volumes grub should be installed

### Regarding partitioning

In general, we recommend against partitioning `/var`, `/opt`, `/usr`, `/bin`, `/etc`, `/lib`, `/tmp` and `/root` on separate partitions. This will prevent you from having to worry about full partitions that could crash your machine, cause app installations to fail, or even corrupt your databases.

For performance reasons, it is recommended to mount your fastest storage (SSD) on the root `/`.

If you have one or more hard drives to store data, you can choose to mount it on one of these folders depending on your usage.

| Path                             | Contents |
| -------------------------------- | -------- |
| `/home`                          | User folders accessible via SFTP |
| `/home/yunohost.backup/archives` | YunoHost backups to be placed ideally elsewhere than on the disks that manage the data |
| `/home/yunohost.app`             | Heavy data from YunoHost applications (nextcloud, matrix...) |
| `/home/yunohost.multimedia`      | Heavy data shared between several applications |
| `/var/mail`                      | User mail |

If you want flexibility and don't want to (re)size partitions, you can also choose to mount on `/mnt/hdd` and follow this [tutorial to mount all these folders with `mount --bind`](/admin/tutorials/external_storage).

### About encryption

Be aware that if you encrypt all or part of your disks, you will have to type the passphrase every time you restart your server, which can be a problem if you are not on site. There are however solutions (quite difficult to implement) that allow you to type the passphrase via SSH or via a web page (search for "dropbear encrypted disk").

### About RAID

Keep in mind that:

- the disks in your RAIDs must be of different brands, wear and tear or batches (especially if they are SSDs)
- a RAID 1 (even without a spare) is more reliable than a RAID 5 from a probability point of view
- hardware raids are dependent on the raid card, if the card fails you will need a replacement to read and rebuild the array

:::info
If the YunoHost installer fails and you can't solve the issue, know that it's also possible to install Debian and then install YunoHost on top. See [the specific instructions](/admin/get_started/install_on/on_top_of_debian).
