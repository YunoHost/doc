## <FAIcon icon="fa-list-alt"/> Pre-requisites

- A Raspberry Pi 3, 4 or 5
  - A power supply (either an adapter or a USB cable) for your board;
  - A microSD card: 16GB capacity (at least), [class "A1"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD_card#Class) highly recommended (such as [this SanDisk A1 card](https://www.amazon.fr/SanDisk-microSDHC-Adaptateur-homologu%C3%A9e-Nouvelle/dp/B073JWXGNT/));
  - An ethernet cable (RJ-45) to connect your server to your router.
- A [reasonable ISP](/admin/get_started/providers/isp/), preferably with a good and unlimited upstream bandwidth
- A computer to read this guide, flash the image and access your server.

:::warning
Support for Raspberry Pi 2 was dropped. If you really want to install YunoHost on a Pi 2, download and install
"Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit)" from [the official website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/)
and then [follow the instructions](./on_top_of_debian) to install YunoHost on Debian.
:::

## <FAIcon icon="fa-download" /> Download the YunoHost image

:::note
(FIXME: this bit is currently broken...)

Optionally, you can [download the project's public key](https://forge.yunohost.org/keys/yunohost_bookworm.asc) to check the authenticity of the images.

## <FAIcon icon="fa-sim-card"/> Flash the YunoHost image

Now that you downloaded the image of YunoHost, you should flash it on a microSD card

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="etcher" label="With Etcher (recommended)">

    Download <Link to="https://www.balena.io/etcher/" target="_blank">Etcher</Link> for your operating system and install it.

    Plug your SD card, select your image and click "Flash"

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="usbimager" label="With USBimager">

Download [USBimager](https://bztsrc.gitlab.io/usbimager/) for your operating system and install it.

Plug your SD card, select your image and click "Write"

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dd" label="With dd">

If you are on GNU/Linux / macOS and know your way around command line, you may also flash your USB stick or SD card with `dd`. You can identify which device corresponds to your USB stick or SD card with `fdisk -l` or `lsblk`. A typical SD card name is something like `/dev/mmcblk0`. BE CAREFUL and make sure you got the right name.

Then run:

```bash
# Replace /dev/mmcblk0 if the name of your device is different...
dd if=/path/to/yunohost.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 status=progress ; sync
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## <FAIcon icon="fa-plug"/> Power up the board

- Put the SD card in your board
- Connect your board to your home router via Ethernet
  - For advanced users requiring WiFi instead, please follow [the official documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#connect-to-a-wireless-network).
- If you want to follow the initial boot, connect a screen and keyboard on your board.
- Power up the board
