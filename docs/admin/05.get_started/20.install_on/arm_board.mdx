## <FAIcon icon="fa-list-alt"/> Pre-requisites

- An ARM board with at least 512MB RAM
- A power supply (either an adapter or a USB cable) for your board;
- A microSD card: 16GB capacity (at least), [class "A1"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD_card#Class) highly recommended (such as [this SanDisk A1 card](https://www.amazon.fr/SanDisk-microSDHC-Adaptateur-homologu%C3%A9e-Nouvelle/dp/B073JWXGNT/));
- A [reasonable ISP](/admin/get_started/providers/isp/), preferably with a good and unlimited upstream bandwidth
- An ethernet cable (RJ-45) to connect your server to your router.
- A computer to read this guide, flash the image and access your server.

:::warning
Each ARM board is different and there might be specific instructions for your board.

Please follow the Armbian documentation first!

## <FAIcon icon="fa-download" /> Download the Armbian image

You should download the Armbian **Bookworm** (Debian 12) image from your vendor's or Armbian's website. 

<div class="text--center">
  <Button url="https://www.armbian.com/download" color="lightblue"><SmallInline url="/img/icons/logo-armbian.png" alt="armbian logo"/> Armbian Download page</Button>
</div>

<YunoHostImagesList hardware="arm"/>

## <FAIcon icon="sim-card"/> Flash the Armbian image

Now that you downloaded the image of Armbian, you should flash it on a microSD card

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="etcher" label="With Etcher (recommended)">

Download <Link to="https://www.balena.io/etcher/" target="_blank">Etcher</Link> for your operating system and install it.

Plug your SD card, select your image and click "Flash"

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="usbimager" label="With USBimager">

Download [USBimager](https://bztsrc.gitlab.io/usbimager/) for your operating system and install it.

Plug your SD card, select your image and click "Write"

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dd" label="With dd">

If you are on GNU/Linux / macOS and know your way around command line, you may also flash your USB stick or SD card with `dd`. You can identify which device corresponds to your USB stick or SD card with `fdisk -l` or `lsblk`. A typical SD card name is something like `/dev/mmcblk0`. BE CAREFUL and make sure you got the right name.

Then run:

```bash
# Replace /dev/mmcblk0 if the name of your device is different...
dd if=/path/to/armbian.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 status=progress ; sync
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## <FAIcon icon="fa-plug"/> Power up the board

- Put the SD card in your board
- Connect your board to your home router via Ethernet
  - For advanced users requiring WiFi instead, please follow [the official documentation](https://docs.armbian.com/User-Guide_Autoconfig/#sample-config-file).
- If you want to follow the initial boot, connect a screen and keyboard on your board.
- Power up the board

## <FAIcon icon="fa-terminal"/> Connect to the board

Next you need to [find the local IP address of your server](/admin/get_started/post_install/find_ip) to connect as root user [via SSH](/admin/command_line) with the temporary password `1234` (see [the Armbian doc](https://docs.armbian.com/User-Guide_Getting-Started/#how-to-login)).

```bash
ssh root@192.168.x.xxx
```
