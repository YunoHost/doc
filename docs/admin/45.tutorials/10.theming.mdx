## Options for the Portal customization

### Show the list of public apps to visitors
Visitors will see a 'public apps' page when ending up on the portal instead of just the login form.

### Show other domain's apps

All apps from all domains will be visible on the portal. Default value is `true`.

### Custom title

Choose a Title for the Portal

### Custom logo

Choose a image. Accept .svg, .png and .jpeg. Prefer a monochrome .svg with `fill: currentColor` so that the logo adapts to the themes.

### Default color theme

Choose a color theme. Users are allowed to choose another one in their settings.
