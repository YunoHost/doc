YunoHost is easily installable on Debian !

This can be useful if you already have a Debian machine or can't use the recommended methods. 

## <FAIcon icon="fa-download" /> Get Debian

You should download the version **Bookworm** (Debian 12) and select the architecture for your PC.

When in doubt, select `amd64`, or `i386` for a pre-2010 PC.

  <Button url="https://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst" color="lightblue"><SmallInline url="/img/icons/logo-debian.png" alt="armbian logo"/> Debian Download page</Button>
</div>

Alternatively, you can browse the [Debian archive](https://cdimage.debian.org/mirror/cdimage/archive) for the latest 12.x version, select your architecture, the select `iso-cd` and download the `netinst` iso.

<!-- <YunoHostImagesList hardware="arm"/> -->

#### Installation

You might want to **wipe the hard drive** before starting the Debian installer.

Burn the iso to your USB key, for example using [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

Debian installer will ask for a **hostname** and a **domain name**. You can use `yunohost` and `yunohost.local`. It is not that important since the YunoHost Installer will overwrite those anyway.

Debian will ask for a **root password**, which should be reaonably complex as it is your primary defense to possible attacks.

The installer will also ask for a **user account** and another password.
:::warning
**IMPORTANT:** this username should be DIFFERENT from the first YunoHost user which you will choose during YunoHost's posinstall… For example, you can name it `debian`. Be sure to also use a long complex password.
:::

When the install asks where to install and how to **create disk partitions**, select the option to **use the whole disk**, unless you know what you're doing.

- We recommend not to separate the `/home`, `/var` or `/tmp` partitions. Use the option to “keep all files in one partition”.
- If you don't know what you're doing, don't encrypt the disk (Decryption at power-on will be an issue)

The installer will ask about **mirrors**. Select a country and server close to your location, or use the default options.

The installer will ask which **desktop environment** you want. This is generally useless and might waste resources.
- Unselect all desktop environment
- Keep “standard system utilities” checked

#### After installing Debian

1. Remove the installation media (unplug the USB stick)
2. Reboot
3. Login as `root`
4. Install curl by typing `apt install curl`
