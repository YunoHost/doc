title: Configure email clients
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

You can fetch and send emails using your YunoHost instance from desktop email clients such as Thunderbird Desktop or on your smartphone with applications like K-9 Mail.

Modern mail clients should be able to configure themselves automatically. If autoconfiguration fails, you can do it manually following the instructions below. (If the autoconfiguration fails though, it should be understood as a bug in YunoHost, and we would be glad to read your feedback to try to reproduce the issue on our side!)

### Generic settings

Here are the element you should enter to manually configure your mail client (`domain.tld` refers to what's after the @ in your email address, and `username` what's before @).

| Protocol | Port | Encryption | Authentication  | Username                               |
| :--:     | :-:  | :--:       | :--:            | :--:                                   |
| IMAP     | 993  | SSL/TLS    | Normal password | `username` (without the `@domain.tld`) |
| SMTP     | 587  | STARTTLS   | Normal password | `username` (without the `@domain.tld`) |

### Client by client

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="thunderbird" label="Mozilla Thunderbird">

##### <SmallInline url='/img/icons/logo-thunderbird.png'/> Configure Thunderbird Desktop (on a desktop computer)

To manually configure a new account in Thunderbird Desktop, add the account information, then click on 'Configure manually'.

- For the incoming server, use IMAP with port 993 and SSL/TLS.
- For outgoing server, use port 587 with STARTTLS. 
- Select 'Normal Password' for the the authentication method of both. 

You may need to accept the certificate exceptions for fetching mails and after you send your first mail. Don't forget to remove the dot before the domain name.

<TabItem value="dekko" label="Dekko">

##### <SmallInline url='/img/icons/logo-dekko.png'/> Configure Dekko (on Ubuntu Touch)

The first time you can simply choose "Add account". If you already have an account configured, tap the hamburger menu then tap the gear, choose Mail, Accounts and press the '+'-symbol.

Then you choose IMAP. Fill in the fields and press Next. Now Dekko will look for the configuration. Check that all fields are correct. Make sure you have your YunoHost username, NOT your email address and choose "Allow untrusted certificates". Do this for IMAP and SMTP and press Next. Dekko will now synchronise the account after which you are done. Congratz!
