YunoHost comes with a complete mail stack allowing you to host your own email server, and therefore to have your own email addresses in `something@your.domain.tld`.

The mail stack includes an SMTP server (Postfix), an IMAP server (Dovecot), antispam (Rspamd) and DKIM configuration.

## Making sure your setup is right

Email is a complicated ecosystem and quite a few details can prevent it from working properly.

To validate your setup:

- if you are self-hosting at home and not using a VPN, ensure [your ISP doesn't block port 25](/admin/get_started/providers/isp/) ;
- route ports according to [this documentation](/admin/get_started/post_install/port_forwarding) ;
- carefully configure mail DNS records according to [this documentation](/admin/get_started/post_install/dns_config) ;
- test your configuration using the diagnostic features (<HighlightWebAdmin/> → <HighlightDiagnosis/> → <Highlight no_break={true} color='grey'><FAIcon icon="fa-envelope"/> Email</Highlight> ). You can also use [mail-tester.com](https://mail-tester.com); a score of at least 8~9/10 is a reasonable goal <small>(be careful: only 3 tests per domain per day are allowed)</small>

## Email clients

To interact with the email server (read and send emails), you can either install a webmail client such as Roundcube or Rainloop on your server or configure a desktop/mobile client as described in [this page](/admin/email/clients).

Desktop and mobile clients have the advantage of copying your emails to the device, allowing offline viewing and relative protection against possible hardware failures of your server.

## Configuring email aliases and auto-forwards

Mail aliases and forwards can be configured for each user. For instance, the first user created on the server automatically has an alias `root@the.domain.tld` configured—meaning that an email sent to this address will end up in the inbox of the first user. Automatic forwards may be configured, for instance if a user doesn't want to configure an additional email account and just wants to receive emails from the server on, say, his/her Gmail address (a copy of each email will be kept on the YunoHost server).

Another feature which few people know about is the use of suffixes beginning with "+". For example, emails sent to `johndoe+booking@the.domain.tld` will automatically land in the `booking` directory (lowercase) of John Doe's mailbox or in John Doe's inbox if the `booking` directory doesn't exist. It is a practical technique, for example, to provide an email address to a website, then easily sort (via automatic filters) the mail coming from this website.

Groups also can use alias features; by default, the group `admins` has aliases such as `root@<domain.tld>` and `webmaster@<domain.tld>`. [More info on the groups and permissions page](/admin/users/groups_and_permissions).

## What happens if my server becomes unavailable?

If your server becomes unavailable, emails sent to your server will stay in a pending queue on the sender's side for as long as ~5 days. The sender's host will regularly try to resend the email, until it drops it if it was unable to send it.
