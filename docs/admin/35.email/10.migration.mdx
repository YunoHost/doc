title: Migrate emails to YunoHost
---

*[Documentation linked to YunoHost email](/admin/email)*.

Migration of emails from one server to another can be done with two recommended tools: ImapSync or Larch.

This tool must be installed on your desktop computer. The transfer method looks at this schema:

**`Old email server −> desktop computer with ImapSync or Larch −> new email server`**

### ImapSync

[ImapSync site](http://imapsync.lamiral.info/)

Install ImapSync on your client computer by following this [guide](http://imapsync.lamiral.info/INSTALL):

```bash
sudo dnf install imapsync # Under Fedora
```

Transfer emails from one server to another:

```bash
imapsync --host1 <domain/IP> --port1 993 --ssl1 --user1 <user> --password1 <password> \
--host2 <domain/IP> --port2 993 --ssl2 --user2 <user> --password2 <password>
```

Note that transfer settings `--port 993` and `--ssl` are specific to YunoHost email server.

### Larch

[New Larch site](https://github.com/driftlesslabs/larch)

After beforehand installed `gem`, install `larch` on your client computer:

```bash
sudo gem install larch
```

Transfer emails from one server to another:

```bash
larch -a -f imaps://server_of_origin.org -t imaps://server_of_destination.org
```

For other types of transfer refer to [New Larch documentation](https://larch.driftless.xyz/v6.0/index.html) [Old Larch documentation](https://github.com/rgrove/larch#label-Usage).
