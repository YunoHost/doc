title: DNS Configuration
---

DNS (domain name system) is a system that converts human-readable addresses
(domain names) into machine-understandable addresses (IP). For your server to be
easily accessible by human beings, and for some services like mail to work
properly, DNS must be configured.

If you're using an [automatic domain](/admin/domains/dns_nohost_me) provided by the YunoHost Project, the configuration should be
performed automatically. If you're using your own domain name (e.g. bought via
a registrar), this page should explain how to manually configure your domain on your 
registrar's interface.

Note YunoHost supports the [automatic configuration of DNS records](/admin/domains/#dns-configuration) for some registrar.

## A brief explanation of domain names 

Because understanding domains can be tricky, it might be worth detailing how they work.

A domain is a human-readable address made out of *labels* concatenated by dots.

So if you take the domain name `www.yunohost.org` the usual convention is to break it down as:

| domain             | description            |
| :---------------:  | :--------------------: |
| `.org`             | top-level domain       |
| `yunohost.org`     | apex/root/bare domain  |
| `www.yunohost.org` | subdomain              |

However from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name) we can learn:

> *Domain names are organized in subordinate levels (subdomains) of the DNS root domain, which is nameless.*

So in theory `yunohost.org` is a subdomain of `.org` but for convenience we usually
talk about *subdomain* for any domain that has 2 levels after the top-level domain.
This become even more confusing if you consider that some top-level domains have 2 labels
(e.g. `.gouv.fr` or `.co.uk`).

The wikipedia quote also mention the "DNS root domain" which is usually omitted but
when not, is represented by a single dot at the end. This form is referred to as 
"fully qualified domain name" (FQDN). With our previous example, `www.yunohost.org.` would be an FQDN. 
This is good to remember because you usually need to specify an FQDN in your DNS records.

## A brief explanation of DNS records.

:::info
DNS records must be managed through your registrar's interface (the vendor you rent your custom domain from).
:::

In the following explanations you can assume the examples in code blocks use the
DNS [zone file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_file) syntax. The lines we use
have 5 columns separated by a whitespace. Those columns represent the different record's fields:

| name | ttl | record class | record type | record data |
| ---- | --- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |

It's also good to be aware of the following:

- We use placeholder values in the examples ! replace with the appropriate ones for your case.
- We recommend a [TTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live#DNS_records) of 3600s (1 hour). But you can use something else if you know what you're doing.
- Don't put an IPv6 record if you're not sure IPv6 really works on your server ! You might have issues with *Let's Encrypt* if it doesn't.
- The `@` name corresponds to the origin, which is your apex domain name (like `mydomain.tld`)
- Reminder that a domain specified in the data of the record **needs to end with a dot** (to be an FQDN as explained previously).

## Minimal DNS configuration

When registering a custom domain name through the YunoHost interface, this is the minimal
required configuration to have it working.

```autohotkey
;; standard IPv4 record
@ 3600 IN A 111.222.33.44

;; if your server is IPv6 capable you can add an AAAA record
@ 3600 IN AAAA 2222:444:8888:3333:bbbb:5555:3333:1111
```

However, this doesn't allow all features to work and you will notice warnings and errors
when running the *Diagnosis* in the web interface.


## Recommended DNS configuration

YunoHost provides a recommended DNS configuration, available via:

- the webadmin, in `Domains` > `{yourdomain.tld}` > `DNS`;
- or the command line, `yunohost domain dns suggest yourdomain.tld`

For specific needs or specific setups, and if you know what you're doing, you
might want or have to tweak these, or add additional ones (e.g. to handle
subdomains).

The recommended configuration typically looks like this:

```autohotkey
;; standard IPv4 records
@ 3600 IN A 111.222.33.44
* 3600 IN A 111.222.33.44

;; if your server is IPv6 capable you can add AAAA records
@ 3600 IN AAAA 2222:444:8888:3333:bbbb:5555:3333:1111
* 3600 IN AAAA 2222:444:8888:3333:bbbb:5555:3333:1111

;; Mail (MX, SPF, DKIM and DMARC)
@               3600 IN MX  10 mydomain.tld.
@               3600 IN TXT "v=spf1 a mx -all"
mail._domainkey 3600 IN TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=someHuuuuuuugeKey"
_dmarc          3600 IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=none"
```


## Subdomains

YunoHost allows the use of subdomains. If you rent a domain name `mydomain.com`,
you can create a subdomain `blog.mydomain.com`.

```autohotkey
@      3600 IN A     111.222.33.44
@      3600 IN AAAA  2222:444:8888:3333:bbbb:5555:3333:1111
*      3600 IN CNAME mydomain.com.
agenda 3600 IN CNAME mydomain.com.
blog   3600 IN CNAME mydomain.com.
rss    3600 IN CNAME mydomain.com.
```

The above allow you to access `agenda.mydomain.com`, `blog.mydomain.com` and `rss.mydomain.com` subdomains.

However you might be in the position where your apex domain is already in use for another service
(the `@ A` record is already in use).
In that case you might want to have this DNS configuration instead:

```autohotkey
agenda 3600 IN A    XYZ.XYZ.XYZ.XYZ
agenda 3600 IN AAAA 1234:1234:1234:FFAA:FFAA:FFAA:FFAA:AAFF
blog   3600 IN A    XYZ.XYZ.XYZ.XYZ
blog   3600 IN AAAA 1234:1234:1234:FFAA:FFAA:FFAA:FFAA:AAFF
rss    3600 IN A    XYZ.XYZ.XYZ.XYZ
rss    3600 IN AAAA 1234:1234:1234:FFAA:FFAA:FFAA:FFAA:AAFF
```

## Reverse DNS

If your ISP or VPS provider let you define a [Reverse DNS
lookup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_DNS_lookup) for your public IPv4
and/or IPv6 addresses, you must configure it. It will prevent you to be marked as
spam by anti-spam filters.

:::note
The reverse DNS configuration happens on your Internet Service Provider or VPS provider. It is NOT handled by your domain's registrar.
:::

If your public IPv4 address is `111.222.333.444` and your DNS
domain is `mydomain.tld`, you should get following answer when using `nslookup`
command tool:

```bash
nslookup 111.222.333.444
444.333.222.111.in-addr.arpa    name = mydomain.tld.
```

From the web interface, you can run the *Diagnosis* and check in the *Email* section
if reverse DNS is configured, and if not to which value it must be set to.

## Dynamic IP

If your global IP address is constantly changing, [follow this tutorial](/admin/tutorials/domains/dns_dynamicip).
