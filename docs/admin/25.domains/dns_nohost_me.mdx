title: YunoHost's free domains
---

In order to make self-hosting as accessible as possible, the YunoHost Project provides 
a *free* and *automatically configured* domain name service. By using this service, 
you won't have to [configure DNS records](/admin/domains/dns_configuration) yourself, 
which can be tedious and technical.

This service is offered during the post-installation setup, but check the 
[Creating a domain after the post-installation](#creating-a-free-domain-after-the-post-installation)
section below for usage afterwards.

During creation of the domain you are prompted to choose a *base domain* and a unique *subdomain* you want to use. 
The following *base domains* are offered:

- `nohost.me`
- `noho.st`
- `ynh.fr`

> For example you may choose to end up with the `frogenjoyer.nohost.me` subdomain.


:::info
To limit resources costs and abuses, each instance may only have one of these domain
setup at any given time.
:::

### Creating additional subdomains

Even after creating your subdomain, you can prepend more subdomain to it, allowing
your applications to each have an unique subdomain if desired (which is also
a workaround for the one free domain per instance).

> For example you picked the `frogenjoyer.ynh.fr` subdomain. For a blog application, you
>  can create an additional `blog.frogenjoyer.ynh.fr` subdomain. 
>  There's no limit so you could also create a `pond.place.frogenjoyer.ynh.fr` subdomain !

### Creating a free domain after the post-installation

<Tabs groupId="admin-commands">
  <TabItem value="web" label="From the web interface">
If you already did the post-install and want to add a free domain, you may do so 
from the *Domains* web interface, selecting the option "I don't have a domain name...".
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="From the command line">
Alternatively, the following commands can be used.

Add the domain
```bash
yunohost domain add frogenjoyer.nohost.me
```
At this step, you should be prompted for a DynDNS recovery password, this password could be used to reset your dyndns free domain in order to register it again on an other yunohost, or during a reinstallation.

(optional) Set it as the main domain
```
yunohost domain main-domain -n frogenjoyer.nohost.me
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Retrieving an existing free domain

If you reinstall your server and want to use a domain already used previously, follow the
creation process as you would if it was new (so use the same subdomain label). However,
in the password field enter the password you have defined when creating the
domain in the past.

If you forgot your password you may need to [request a manual domain reset](https://forum.yunohost.org/t/nohost-domain-recovery/442).

:::note
The password feature is available since YunoHost 11.2, previously you would need to 
use the [dedicated forum thread](https://forum.yunohost.org/t/nohost-domain-recovery/442).
:::

### Changing your free domain

If you wish to use a different free domain, you first have to remove your present domain registration:

- using the web interface > `Domains` > `{yourdomain.tld}` > `delete` button

:::note
You can check the "Also unregister" option to permanently free the domain; otherwise
you can still re-use it with the password set on creation.
:::

- from the command line using `yunohost domain remove`

You may then add a new domain.
