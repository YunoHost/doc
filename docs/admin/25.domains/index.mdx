YunoHost lets you manage and serve multiple domains on a single server. So you can host, for example, a blog and Nextcloud on a first domain `yolo.com`, and a webmail client on a second domain `swag.nohost.me`. Each domain is automatically configured to handle web services and e-mail.

Domains can be managed in the 'Domains' section of the webadmin, or via the `yunohost domain` category of the command line.

## Adding a new domain

When registering domains on your instance, you are being presented with 4 options:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="nohost" label="Yunohost's free domains (the easy way)">

In order to make self-hosting as accessible as possible, the YunoHost Project provides a *free* and *automatically configured* domain name service. By using this service, you won't have to configure DNS records yourself, which can be tedious and technical.

The following base domains are offered: `nohost.me`, `noho.st`, `ynh.fr`.

[Learn more about YunoHost's free domain here](/admin/domains/dns_nohost_me).

To get one of this domain you simply need to choose `I don't own a domaine name‚Ä¶` option.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="own" label="Your own domains">

Having your own domain brings several advantages:

- more control and autonomy
- simpler domain name (for example directly in .net or .org)

However, you have to pay for it each year (about 15‚Ç¨/year ... depending on the TLD) and you have to do some extra configuration to [setup a correct DNS zone](/admin/domains/dns_configuration). Our diagnosis tool can trigger alert to help you to do this configuration.
If you don't have a custom domain yet, we suggest you to buy it from a [registrar whose API is supported by YunoHost](/admin/get_started/providers/registrar/) to simplify and automate the DNS configuration.

[Learn more about DNS configuration here](/admin/domains/dns_configuration)

This option corresponds to the `I want to add a domain I own` option in the web interface:

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="subdomain" label="A subdomain of an added domain">

A subdomain allow you to prepend multiple labels to existing domains you own. This
is especially convenient for applications, as you can define an unique subdomain for 
each of them.

> Example, you previously added the custom domain `bonjour.fr`; you can create 
> multiple subdomain at `blog.bonjour.fr`, `cloud.bonjour.fr`, and so on.

[Learn more about subdomains here](/admin/domains/dns_configuration/#a-brief-explanation-of-domain-names).

This option corresponds to the `I want to add a subdomain of an already added domain` option in the web interface:

![A screenshot of the "Add domain" page where you can choose "I want to add a subdomain of an already added domain"](/img/webadmin/webadmin_domain_subdomain.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="local" label="Local domains">

Starting from YunoHost v4.3, domains ending by `.local` are fully supported, in addition to the default `yunohost.local`.
They do not use the DNS protocol, but the mDNS one (also known as Zeroconf, Bonjour), which allows them to be published with no specific configuration but exclusively on your local network or VPN.
Their use is especially suitable when you do not need your apps to be available on the Internet.

:::info
mDNS protocol does not allow for subdomains to be created. So `domain.local` will work, while `sub.domain.local` is not possible.
:::

`Yunomdns` service takes care of publishing your `.local` domains on your network.
It has a configuration file, `/etc/yunohost/mdns.yml`, which allows you to choose which domains are published, and on which network interfaces.
This file is automatically regenerated whenever you add or delete a `.local` domain.

The service will always try to publish `yunohost.local`. If you have multiple YunoHost servers on your network, try `yunohost-2.local`, and so on.
The number may change depending on which server starts first, so do not rely on it to use actual apps and create your own domains.

:::caution
Unfortunately, Android devices before version 12 (released in 2021) do not seem to be listening to mDNS protocol.
To be able to reach `.local` domains on your Android devices, you will have to add in their DNS settings your YunoHost server's local IP address.
:::

This option corresponds to the `I want a domain for local usage / test only` option in the web interface:

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Installing an application on a domain

During the installation of an application, you are being prompted to which domain the
application must be configured to.

Even if you teh domain can be later changed, it is recommended you register the domain in 
your instance before installing the application.

:::tip
It is common to install the application on a subdomain, but this is personal preferences.

> Example: `blog.mydomain.tld` instead of using `mydomain.tld` or `mydomain.tld/blog`
:::


## Changing an application assigned domain.

You can change the application domain:

- through the web interface > `Applications` > `{app name}` > `Operations`
- through the command line with `yunohost app change-url`

:::note
Some applications do not allow you to change domains. In general, it is still possible to make the change manually, but this operation requires a variety of system administration skills.
:::

## DNS configuration

Once a domain is added, you may need to manage its DNS configuration.

[Learn more about DNS configuration here](/admin/domains/dns_configuration).

YunoHost can help you manage the DNS configuration by generating or automatically
setting it depending on your registrar.

- in the web interface via `Domains` > `{yourdomain.tld}` > `DNS`.
- with the command `yunohost domain dns suggest yourdomain.tld`.

For automatic DNS configuration, check the [Registrars page](/admin/get_started/providers/registrar/).

## About Non-latin characters

If your domain has special, non-latin characters, it will be transformed by YunoHost into its [internationalized version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name) through [Punycode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode). So when you use the command line, you have to use the punycode format return for example by `yunohost domain list`.

## SSL/HTTPS certificates

Another important aspect of domain configuration is the SSL/HTTPS certificate. YunoHost is integrated with Let's Encrypt, so once your server is correctly reachable from anybody on the internet through the domain name, the administrator can request a Let's Encrypt certificate. See the documentation about [certificates](/admin/domains/certificate) for more information.
