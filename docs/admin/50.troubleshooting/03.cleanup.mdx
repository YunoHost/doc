If your system runs out of space, you may an emergency option to get back some bit of space, and investigate what's taking up space

## Execute the basic-space-cleanup tool

One may use the following command, to perform basic space cleanup (apt, journalctl, logs, ...) :

```bash
sudo yunohost tools basic-space-cleanup
```

Additionaly, you may want to cleanup YunoHost operation logs if they are taking too much space, cf [this issue](https://github.com/YunoHost/issues/issues/2329).

## Explore what's taking up space

Install `ncdu`:

```bash
sudo apt install ncdu
```

Then use it to scan the filesystem and have a dynamic, browsable report of what's using space:

```bash
ncdu /
```

or `ncdu /var/`, for example to scan only `/var/`
