description: Chat rooms on Matrix for support and development
---

Among other communication tools, YunoHost project use chat rooms to communicate.

You could join those chat rooms using:

- a [Matrix client](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/)
- a [XMPP client](https://xmpp.org/software/)
- an [IRC Client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients) for example [KiwiIRC](https://web.libera.chat/#yunohost) (please note that the IRC room is deprecated, prefer Matrix). <small>If you're using KiwiIrc, please change your username, as we got legions of `ynhuser`s.</small>

:::caution
The IRC bridge is currently down. XMPP and Matrix are still bridged together, but IRC is probably way less active as most of the team coordinates via Matrix.
