The YunoHost project extensively uses Git and GitHub (though we hope to move to a different platform oneday™)

In particular:
- [the `YunoHost` organization](https://github.com/YunoHost/) hosts the "core" of YunoHost, along with tools that are transversal to the project such that [the app store](https://github.com/YunoHost/appstore), [this very documentation](https://github.com/YunoHost/doc), etc.
- [the `YunoHost-Apps` organization](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/) hosts the repo corresponding to the different apps

Explaining how Git and GitHub works is beyond the scope of this documentation, but we can recommend:
- [this super quick intro](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
- [this Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk)
- [this guide, on how to make you very first Pull Request in GitHub](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/main/README.md) - also available in other languages - c.f. the flags at the top, for example [in french](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/main/docs/translations/README.fr.md)!
- There are plenty of tutorials about Git and GitHub on the internets, find one that works for you, and come talk with other folks!
