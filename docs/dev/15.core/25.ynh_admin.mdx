# Working on the YunoHost web admin

When using `ynh-dev`, run in the container:

```
./ynh-dev use-git yunohost-admin
```

It launches gulp, such as each time you modify sources, it recompiles the code and
you can use it by refreshing (Ctrl+F5) your web administration.

To stop the command, just do Ctrl+C.

:::warning
You might need to force-clear the cache of your browser sometimes to refresh
the JavaScript and/or HTML (so each time you edit something in `js` or `views`).

The web interface uses the API to interact with YunoHost. The API
commands/requests are also defined via the actionsmap. For instance, accessing
the page `https://domain.tld/yunohost/api/users` corresponds to a `GET
/users` requests on the YunoHost API. It is mapped to the function
`user_list()`. Accessing the URL should display the JSON returned by this
function. 'GET' requests are typically meant to ask information to the server.
'POST' requests are meant to ask the server to edit/change some information,
or to execute some actions.

- `js/yunohost/controllers` contains the JavaScript parts,
  and define which requests to make to the API when loading a specific page of
  the interface, and how to process the data to generate the page, using
  templates.

- `views` contains the various templates for the pages of the interface. In the
  template, data coming from the JavaScript part can be used with the syntax
  `{{some-variable}}`, which will be replaced when building/accessing the page.
  It is also possible to have conditions using the
  [handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com) syntax: `{{#if
  some-variable}}<p>Some conditional HTML code here !</p>{{/if}}`

- For internationalized strings, use `y18n.t('some-string-code')` in the
  JavaScript, or `{{t 'some-string-code'}}` in the HTML template, and put your
  string in `locales/en.json`. Don't edit other locales files,
  this will be done using [Weblate](https://translate.yunohost.org/)!
