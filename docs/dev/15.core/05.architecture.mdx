title: YunoHost architecture
---

The core of YunoHost is built in Python around the `yunohost` server, but is composed
of four main components:

## Moulinette

It is a small "homemade" framework. [Its major role](https://moulinette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/actionsmap.html)
is to allow us to build both a web API and a command-line API from the same
Python code thanks to a YAML schema which we call
[the actionmap](https://github.com/YunoHost/yunohost/blob/dev/share/actionsmap.yml).

It handles other mechanisms like authentication, internationalization and
small technical utilitary functions (e.g. reading/writing JSON).

Moulinette has its own documentation available [here](https://moulinette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## YunoHost

This piece is the very core of YunoHost. It contains:

- [The Python code](https://github.com/YunoHost/yunohost/tree/dev/src) that manages users, domains, apps, services and other things
- [Bash helpers](https://github.com/YunoHost/yunohost/tree/dev/helpers) mainly used by application packagers to package applications
- [Hooks](https://github.com/YunoHost/yunohost/tree/dev/hooks) and [templates](https://github.com/YunoHost/yunohost/tree/dev/conf) that are used to configure the various pieces of the ecosystem such as NGINX, Postfix...
- [Internationalized strings](https://github.com/YunoHost/yunohost/tree/dev/locales)
- [Tests](https://github.com/YunoHost/yunohost/tree/dev/tests)

## SSOwat

This is the single sign-on system of YunoHost. It both contains:

- [Lua scripts](https://github.com/YunoHost/ssowat) that are directly interfaced with NGINX and handle all the "technical" aspects of authentication and route accesses
- The web [user portal](https://github.com/YunoHost/yunohost-portal) which is the interface used by YunoHost's end users to log in and browse installed apps

SSOwat is configured through `/etc/ssowat/conf.json` which is generated by YunoHost.

## YunoHost-admin

It is an *optional* dependency of YunoHost and corresponds to an interface for the web API created by YunoHost and Moulinette (c.f. the `yunohost-api` service).

It essentially contains:

- [View templates](https://github.com/YunoHost/yunohost-admin/tree/dev/app/src/views)
- Corresponding [JavaScript controllers](https://github.com/YunoHost/yunohost-admin/tree/dev/src/js/yunohost/controllers) that interact with the YunoHost API
- [Internationalized strings](https://github.com/YunoHost/yunohost-admin/tree/dev/app/src/i18n/locales)
