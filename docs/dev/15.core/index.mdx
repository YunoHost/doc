You have found a bug or want to work on a new feature in the Yunohost core ?
Well, thanks!

If you're looking for stuff to implement or fix, please see [the bug-tracker](https://github.com/YunoHost/issues/issues).

We recommend to **not** develop on your own machine where you might store important
data. Instead, most of the testing can be done in [Incus containers](./devenv#incus).

Here are the suggested steps to work on the core:
* Identify the components you want to work on (see [the Core architecture](architecture))
* Install and configure [Incus](./devenv#incus)
* Install and use [ynh-dev](./devenv#ynh-dev)
* Contribute your changes

**And come say hi in the [dev chat room](/community/chat_rooms)**!


## Contribution workflow

When you want to contribute your changes, you need to:
* Fork the relevant(s) repo(s) on GitHub
* Push your changes to a new branch, with a well-chosen name, for example:
  * For an enhancement or new feature: `enh-ISSUENUMBER-name-of-feature`
  * For a bugfix `fix-ISSUENUMBER-description-of-fix`
  * `ISSUENUMBER` is optional and is the id of a corresponding ticket on the bug tracker.
* Once you're ready, open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub. Please include `[fix]` or
  `[enh]` at the beginning of the title of your PR.
  You can open a draft PR if you are expecting feedback / comments.
* After reviewing, testing and validation by other contributors, your branch
should be merged in `unstable`!
