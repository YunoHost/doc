title: The server and command line

# Working on the server and CLI

When using `ynh-dev`, run in the container:

```
./ynh-dev use-git yunohost
```

If you work on Moulinette too:

```
./ynh-dev use-git moulinette
```


## The actionsmap

The actionsmap file (`data/actionsmap/yunohost.yml`) defines the command line *and*
the API structure. It is structured as "categories", "actions", and "arguments".

For example for the command line `yunohost domain add some.domain.tld`, the
category is `domain`, the action is `add`, and `some.domain.tld` is an argument.


Moulinette will automatically map commands in the actionsmap to Python functions
(and their arguments) located in `src/yunohost/`. For example, typing
`yunohost domain add some.domain.tld` will call the function `domain_add(domainName)`
in `domain.py`, with the argument `domainName` equal to `"some.domain.tld"`.


:::warning
Each time you edit the actionsmap or the Python code, you should restart the YunoHost
api with:
```
systemctl restart yunohost-api
```
You'll need to retype your admin and password in the web interface.

## Coding style

Please follow the standard PEP8 rules, add [Python typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html),
and run the usual linting tools for Python and Bash.

Github Actions will run the linting tools and report errors.

### YunoHost specific rules

- To handle exceptions, you should raise some `YunohostError()`

- To help with internationalizing the messages, use `m18n.n('some-message-id')`
  and put your string in `locales/en.json`. You can also put arguments and use
  them in the string with `{{some-argument:s}}`. Don't edit other locales files,
  this will be done using [weblate](https://translate.yunohost.org/) !

- Name of "private" functions should start with a `_`
