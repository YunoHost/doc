Let's go through the different ways to contribute to the project!

## 📢 Spread the word

Talk about software freedom, [self-hosting](/admin/about_self_hosting) and YunoHost around you! \<3

## 💰 Donate

YunoHost is a volunteer-driven, non-profit community project. Donations help us stay afloat and dedicate more time to the project. Check out [our donation page](https://yunohost.org/donate.html)!

## 🛟 Help others

Our support relies on contributors like you. Join [the support chatroom](/community/chat_rooms) to assist new users, or see if you can [help someone on the forum](https://forum.yunohost.org/)!

## 📝 Improve documentation

Great projects require great documentation! You can [contribute to this documentation](/dev/doc/) by improving existing pages or adding new ones!

## 🌐 Translate

Help make YunoHost accessible to more people by translating its interface into your language on [our translation platform](https://translate.yunohost.org/)!

## 💡 Help us with design

As a tech project, it's easy for us to get caught up in the technical details and forget about making everything intuitive and accessible for non-tech-savvy users. If you have skills in communication, visual identity, design, UX, or just general feedback on the website, documentation, installation process, or everyday use of YunoHost, we’d love to hear from you! Get in touch with us on [the forum](https://forum.yunohost.org/), [the chat rooms](/community/chat_rooms) or [the issue tracker](https://github.com/YunoHost/issues/issues)!

## ⚗️  Participate in testings

We regularly need testers for new versions of YunoHost or app updates. Check out [the project announcements on the forum](https://forum.yunohost.org/c/announcement/8), or if there is a [pending testing for your favourite apps on the packaging dashboard](https://apps.yunohost.org/dash?filter=testings).

## 🏷️ Refine the app catalog

The app catalog is an important aspect of YunoHost. We always need help to improve the app catalog experience, for example ensuring that apps are in the appropriate category, with an appropriate logo and screenshot, that their description is relevant and accurate, that they do provide relevant information in the context of YunoHost, etc. Check out for example [this issue](https://github.com/YunoHost/issues/issues/2676) with guidelines on how to contribute on this. We're also open to feedback regarding how the whole design of the catalog could be improved!

## 📦 Package applications

You can extend YunoHost capabilities by packaging new applications. Have a look at [the current catalog](https://apps.yunohost.org/), the [packaging documentation](/dev/packaging/), and join us on the [app packaging chat room](/community/chat_rooms)!

## ⚙️ Develop

YunoHost is built mainly using Python, Bash, and VueJS. Check out the [developer documentation](/dev/core/), and join us on the [development chat room](/community/chat_rooms)! You can also [look for good first issues on our issue tracker](https://github.com/YunoHost/issues/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22+state%3Aopen)!
