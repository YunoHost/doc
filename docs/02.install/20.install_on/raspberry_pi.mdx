## <FAIcon icon="fa-list-alt"/> Pre-requisites

- A Raspberry Pi 3, 4 or 5
  - A power supply (either an adapter or a MicroUSB cable) for your board;
  - A microSD card: 16GB capacity (at least), [class "A1"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD_card#Class) highly recommended (such as [this SanDisk A1 card](https://www.amazon.fr/SanDisk-microSDHC-Adaptateur-homologu%C3%A9e-Nouvelle/dp/B073JWXGNT/));
  - An ethernet cable (RJ-45) to connect your server to your router.
- A [reasonable ISP](/install/providers/isp/), preferably with a good and unlimited upstream bandwidth
- A computer to read this guide, flash the image and access your server.

## <FAIcon icon="fa-download" /> Download the YunoHost image

Now that you downloaded the image of YunoHost, you should flash it on a microSD card

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="etcher" label="With Ether (recommended)">
    Download <Link to="https://www.balena.io/etcher/" target="_blank">Etcher</Link> for your operating system and install it.

    Plug your SD card, select your image and click "Flash"

  <TabItem value="usbimager" label="With USBimager">
    Download [USBimager](https://bztsrc.gitlab.io/usbimager/) for your operating system and install it.

    Plug your SD card, select your image and click "Write"

    If you are on GNU/Linux / macOS and know your way around command line, you may also flash your USB stick or SD card with `dd`. You can identify which device corresponds to your USB stick or SD card with `fdisk -l` or `lsblk`. A typical SD card name is something like `/dev/mmcblk0`. BE CAREFUL and make sure you got the right name.

    Then run:

    ```bash
    # Replace /dev/mmcblk0 if the name of your device is different...
    dd if=/path/to/yunohost.img of=/dev/mmcblk0
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## <FAIcon icon="fa-plug"/> Power up the board

- Plug the ethernet cable (one side on your main router, the other on your board).
  - For advanced users willing to configure the board to connect to WiFi instead, see
  for example [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#connect-to-a-wireless-network)
  ([or here prior to YunoHost12/bookworm](https://www.raspberryme.com/configurer-le-wifi-sur-un-pi-manuellement-a-laide-de-wpa_supplicant-conf/).
- Plug the SD card in your board
- (Optional) You can connect a screen+keyboard directly on your board if you want to troubleshoot the boot process or if you're more comfortable to "see what happens" or want a direct access to the board.
- Power up the board
- Wait a couple minutes while the board autoconfigure itself during the first boot
- Make sure that your computer (desktop/laptop) is connected to the same local network (i.e. same internet box) as your server.
