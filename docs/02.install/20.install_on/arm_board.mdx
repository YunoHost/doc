## <FAIcon icon="fa-list-alt"/> Pre-requisites

- An ARM board with at least 512MB RAM
- A power supply (either an adapter or a MicroUSB cable) for your board;
- A microSD card: 16GB capacity (at least), [class "A1"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD_card#Class) highly recommended (such as [this SanDisk A1 card](https://www.amazon.fr/SanDisk-microSDHC-Adaptateur-homologu%C3%A9e-Nouvelle/dp/B073JWXGNT/));
- A [reasonable ISP](/install/providers/isp/), preferably with a good and unlimited upstream bandwidth
- An ethernet cable (RJ-45) to connect your server to your router.
- A computer to read this guide, flash the image and access your server.

## <FAIcon icon="fa-download" /> Download the Armbian image

<LinkButton url="https://www.armbian.com/download" color="lightblue"><FAIcon icon="fa-external-link"/> Download the image for your board on Armbian's website</LinkButton>

:::tip
You should download the image Armbian Bookworm.

## <FAIcon icon="sim-card"/> Flash the Armbian image

Now that you downloaded the image of Armbian, you should flash it on a microSD card

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="etcher" label="With Ether (recommended)">

    Download <Link to="https://www.balena.io/etcher/" target="_blank">Etcher</Link> for your operating system and install it.

    Plug your SD card, select your image and click "Flash"

    ![Etcher](/img/etcher.gif)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="usbimager" label="With USBimager">
    Download [USBimager](https://bztsrc.gitlab.io/usbimager/) for your operating system and install it.

    Plug your SD card, select your image and click "Write"

    ![USBimager](/img/usbimager.png)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="dd" label="With dd">
    If you are on GNU/Linux / macOS and know your way around command line, you may also flash your USB stick or SD card with `dd`. You can identify which device corresponds to your USB stick or SD card with `fdisk -l` or `lsblk`. A typical SD card name is something like `/dev/mmcblk0`. BE CAREFUL and make sure you got the right name.

    Then run:

    ```bash
    # Replace /dev/mmcblk0 if the name of your device is different...
    dd if=/path/to/armbian.img of=/dev/mmcblk0
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## <FAIcon icon="fa-plug"/> Power up the board

- Plug the ethernet cable (one side on your main router, the other on your board).
  - For advanced users willing to configure the board to connect to WiFi instead, see for example [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#connect-to-a-wireless-network)
  ([or here prior to YunoHost12/bookworm](https://www.raspberryme.com/configurer-le-wifi-sur-un-pi-manuellement-a-laide-de-wpa_supplicant-conf/).
- Plug the SD card in your board
- (Optional) You can connect a screen+keyboard directly on your board if you want to troubleshoot the boot process or if you're more comfortable to "see what happens" or want a direct access to the board.
- Power up the board
- Wait a couple minutes while the board autoconfigure itself during the first boot
- Make sure that your computer (desktop/laptop) is connected to the same local network (i.e. same internet box) as your server.

## <FAIcon icon="fa-terminal"/> Connect to the board

Next you need to [find the local IP address of your server](/install/post_install/finding_the_local_ip) to connect as root user [via SSH](/administer/admin_guide/command_line) with the temporary password `1234`.

```bash
ssh root@192.168.x.xxx
```

## <FAIcon icon="fa-rocket"/> Run the install script

- Open a command line prompt on your server (either directly or [through SSH](/administer/admin_guide/command_line))
- Make sure you are root (or type `sudo -i` to become root)
- Run the following command:

```bash
curl https://install.yunohost.org | bash
```

:::warning
If `curl` is not installed on your system, you might need to install it with `apt install curl`.

Otherwise, if the command does not do anything, you might want to `apt install ca-certificates`
:::

:::note
**Note for advanced users concerned with the `curl|bash` approach:** consider reading ["Is curl|bash insecure?"](https://sandstorm.io/news/2015-09-24-is-curl-bash-insecure-pgp-verified-install) on Sandstom's blog, and possibly [this discussion on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12766350&noprocess).
