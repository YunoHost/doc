# Backup

First make sure that the `archives` folder exists in `/home/yunohost.backup/`. If it does not, create it with:
```bash
sudo mkdir /home/yunohost.backup/archives
```

Launch a backup via 
```bash
sudo yunohost backup create 
```


In this version you can backup with cli or with the web admin. The cli way allows you to do more things. The webadmin way is more accessible.

## Web admin
Basically with the webadmin, you can:

- backup into `/home/yunohost.backup/archives/`
- choose to backup one or more data among:
 - apps data
 - emails
 - home data
 - configuration
- list backups
- see what there is in a backup
- restore selectively a backup

**Caution:** to do a backup, you need to have enough free disk spaces in the destination directory. For example, if you have 20GB in `/home/data` you need to have enough space to contain this 20GB compressed in a tar.gz. To do the tar.gz, yunohost backup uses shallow copies, to avoid to need more spaces to be able to create the tar.gz.

**Caution:** If you use selective restore, be sure to not create discordant operation. For example, if you restore an app using a domain that has been deleted from YunoHost, you need to read the domain or to restore all configuration files.

Here's a list of missing but planned features:

- backup in another memory device
- download/upload backups
- encrypt backups

Some features are almost ready in the webadmin, but the API is not for the moment.

## Command line
### Backup
You can make a full backup by running this command:
```bash
admin@yunohost:~# sudo yunohost backup create
Exécution des scripts de sauvegarde...
Attention : backup script '/etc/yunohost/apps/phpmyadmin/scripts/backup' not found
Attention : App 'phpmyadmin' will not be saved

```
By default, it backups in `/home/yunohost.backup/archives/`, but you can set your own directory with `-o` option. It could be an usb key or an other mounted filesystem.

If an app has no backup script it warns you. 

As you can see in the answer, there is 2 hooks which backup data (data_home and data_mail). By default, the mysql data aren't saved, because the apps should save themselves their databases.


**Note:** `yunohost backup` is not able currently to create diff backup. But you can use `-r` option to avoid compression and use an other backup tool to make diff backup.

### Restore
To do a restore
```bash
admin@yunohost:~# sudo yunohost backup restore 20151126-132533
```
You can choose to apply only some parts of the backup, by selecting which restore hooks and which apps to restore.

## Packaging information
You can see an example to make backup and restore scripts here
https://github.com/YunoHost/example_ynh/tree/testing
and
https://github.com/zamentur/strut_ynh/

There is some helpers to do shadow copy if you have big quantity of data to backup (owncloud, video apps, etc...).

**Note:** during a backup operation, the restore script associated is saved. So in a restore operation, yunohost use the saved restore script and not the most recent script. 

If you want modify a general conf file, you should use hooks to trigger a modification of the conf file after each call of `yunohost regenconf`.
You can also use the regeneration configuration system to do index your conf file, and allow your user to be warn if an upgrade of your app has change a config file.
