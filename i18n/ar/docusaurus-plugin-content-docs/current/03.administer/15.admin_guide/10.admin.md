YunoHost has an administrator web interface. The other way to administrate your YunoHost install is through the [command line](/administer/admin_guide/command_line).

## Access

You can access your administrator web interface at this address: `https://example.org/yunohost/admin` (replace `example.org` with your own domain name)
