msgid "In the context of self-hosting, backups are an important element to compensate for unexpected events (fire, database corruption, loss of access to the server, compromised server...). The backup policy to implement depends on the importance of the services and data you manage. For example, backing up a test server will be of little interest, while you will want to be very careful if you are managing critical data for an association or a company - and in such cases, you will want to store the backups *in a different location or locations*.\n"

"- **Lack of rigor**: strategies based on manual backups require a lot of rigor in the regularity\n"
"- **Bad handling**: it can happen that a backup is erased by mistake during a restoration or if you rely on a synchronization system, you could delete a file and the deletion would be synchronized instantly\n"
"- **Cryptolocker**: this is a virus that encrypts files and demands a ransomware. If your users are using nextcloud and windows, an infected windows could synchronize encrypted files and thus you lose your copy.\n"
"- **Hardware failure**: SD cards are the least reliable media over time (~2 years of life in a server), followed by SSD disks (about 3 years of life) and hard drives (3 years). Note that a new equipment has also probability to break down during the first 6 months. In all cases, your copies should not be on the same physical media.\n"
"- **Software failure/bug**: a software bug may result in data deletion or you may not know how to fix a problem and want to restore your system.\n"
"- **Electricity or internet failure**: do you have a plan if this happens? What if you are on vacation?\n"
"- **Disaster or natural or unnatural event**: a small child, a cat, lightning or a simple leak can destroy your equipment. Fires or floods can also destroy your backup copy at the other end of your home...\n"
"- **Server compromise**: a malicious person or a robot could attack your server and delete your data\n"
"- **Machine theft**: a burglary or theft of a computer on which your password manager is located to decrypt your backups\n"
"- **Search**: whether you are guilty or not, a search can result in the seizure of the entire computer equipment of a place (or even several)\n"
"- **Death/health problem**: you may not be able to type your passphrase anymore\n"

msgid "If this method is easy to set up, it is not without risk because of the synchronization itself. For example, if you are on Windows or Mac, you increase the risk of data loss following the encryption of files by a [cryptolocker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware) type virus. On any type of system, a false manipulation can delete all your copies on the server and on the equipment that synchronizes. This concern is aggravated by the fact that the deletion synchronization is usually rather instantaneous.\n"
