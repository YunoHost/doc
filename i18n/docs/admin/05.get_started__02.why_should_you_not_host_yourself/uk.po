msgid "- **You believe in a free, open and decentralized internet.** In a centralized internet, private companies and government can spy, analyze and influence people by dictating how they connect with each other, and by filtering content. YunoHost is developed by a community who believe in an open and decentralized internet, and we hope that you do, too!\n"

msgid "- **You want to have control of your data and services.** Your pictures, chat messages, browsing history, and that text you are writing for school, have nothing to do on somebody else's server (a.k.a. The Cloud). They are part of your private life, but also part of your family's life, your friend's life, and so on. These data should be managed by *you*, not a random company in the US who wants your data to analyze them and sell the results.\n"

msgid "- **Self-hosting requires some work and patience.** Hosting yourself is a bit like growing your own garden or vegetables: it requires work and patience. While YunoHost aims to do all the hard work for you, self-hosting still requires that you take time to learn and configure a few things to setup your server properly. You will also need to perform maintenance tasks (such as upgrades) from time to time, or to ask for support if some things break.\n"

msgid "- **With great servers comes great responsibilities.** Operating a server means that you are responsible for the data you are hosting. Nobody will be able to recover them for you if they get lost. YunoHost provides backup features, which you should use regularly to backup the configurations and data you care about. You should also keep an eye on security news and recommendations so that your server or critical data don't get compromised.\n"

msgid "- **Quality and performance probably won't be as good as premium services.** YunoHost (and most of the applications packaged for it) are free and open-source software, developed by communities of people in their free time and on the basis of best effort. There is no absolute guarantee that software will work in every possible circumstance. The performance of your self-hosted server is also related to its CPU and RAM, and to the available internet connectivity.\n"
