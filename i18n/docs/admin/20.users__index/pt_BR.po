The administrator can add and manage users through the web administration (in the User category) or through the command line (see `yunohost user --help`). After that, users obtain a personal email address (chosen by the admin), and can log in the user portal to access applications they have permissions over and configure other parameters.\n"

"The user portal, also called the SSO for 'Single Sign On' allows user to browse easily between the different apps they have access to. In particular, the term 'Single Sign On' comes from the fact that user only need to log in the portal to automatically be logged to all apps that require authentication (or at least those who are integrated with the SSO/LDAP, since this is sometimes technically complicated or not possible at all).\n"

This is a bit confusing but is necessary for technical reason. If you are in a situation where you need to access the SSO without having your DNS properly configured for some reason, you might consider tweaking your `/etc/hosts` as described in [this page](/admin/tutorials/domains/dns_local_network).\n"
