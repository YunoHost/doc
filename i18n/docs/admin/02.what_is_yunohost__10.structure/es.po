This is the administrator of the machine who can install, configure and manage things on the server through the web administration interface, or via SSH and the command line interface. *(If you are already familiar with GNU/Linux, it is quite similar to root. YunoHost has this additional 'admin' user for several technical reasons.)*\n"

Users will also be able to connect to the user portal (SSO) to access applications. Some applications can typically be installed either as publicly-accessible, or as private, i.e. only some users will have access to it depending on which groups they are member of.\n"
