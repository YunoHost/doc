msgid "When thinking and discussing security — whether in the context of YunoHost or any other system —, please keep in mind that security is not a binary state, but an ongoing practice. The term \"security\" is essentially meaningless without specifying what exactly we are securing against. The 'threats' to consider depend on your context, and can range from automated attacks from bots roaming the Internet, to sophisticated state actors like the NSA, or supply chain vulnerabilities (e.g., compromised software dependencies), or basic risks such as your own users employing overly simple passwords, or your worst enemy from elementary school 20 years ago trying to hack into your server...\n"

"YunoHost is developped with security in mind, and designing good tradeoff between security and usability. Here's a non-exhaustive list of security aspects that the project is implementing:\n"
"- a firewall based on `nftables` to restrict incoming traffic to relevant ports ;\n"
"- `fail2ban`, a software that automatically rejects traffic from malicious IPs trying to brute force SSH and other services ;\n"
"- using [Mozilla's recommendations for NGINX, Postfix, Dovecot, SSH ciphers etc.](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS) ;\n"
"- checking that user password/passphrase are not too simple when definining them ;\n"
"- hashing user passwords (salted SHA512 in LDAP for example) ;\n"
"- being vigilant on UNIX file/dir permissions accross the whole system ;\n"
"- apps are typically ran using a dedicated user, and with [restricted capabilities](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) ;\n"
"- auto-redacting sensitive informations from YunoHost operation logs and when sharing them with Yunopaste ;\n"
"- ...\n"

"In addition, the project has mid-term goals to implement:\n"
"- [password self-reset for users](https://github.com/YunoHost/issues/issues/878) ;\n"
"- [automatic warnings about vulnerabilities](https://github.com/YunoHost/yunohost/pull/2077) <small>(via the Diagnosis, not via the forum or social media)</small> ;\n"
"- supporting [OIDC](https://github.com/YunoHost/yunohost/pull/2149) and [2FA](https://github.com/YunoHost/issues/issues/238) ;\n"
"- better support for SSH keys, in particular [making them configurable from the webadmin](https://github.com/YunoHost/issues/issues/175) ;\n"
"- further constrain and limit application capabilities to only what they need (cf. packaging v3) ;\n"
