To limit abuse and costs, an instance can only have one domain offered at a time, but you can add as many sub-domains to it as you like. For example, if you choose `example.ynh.co.uk` you can then add the domains `video.example.ynh.co.uk` or `www.exemple.ynh.fr` or any other sub-domain you may require.\n"
