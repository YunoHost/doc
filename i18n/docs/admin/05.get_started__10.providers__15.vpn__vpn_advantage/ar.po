This can be really handy if you are going on vacation, moving or have an Internet disconnection, as you will be able to easily connect it to someone you trust without having to configure the router of the person who is helping you.\n"

msgid "If your Internet connection does not have a fixed public IP, you will be forced to set up a dynamic domain name (Dynamic DNS). This solution may be acceptable, but the DNS will only be updated at regular intervals (every two minutes if it is a `noho.st` or `nohost.me` domain name). So there is a chance that this will cause some display errors in the browser from time to time, or even that another site will be displayed (the risks are however reduced because the practice of self-hosting is not widespread).\n"
