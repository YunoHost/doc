Forget the dream of having a \"clean\" server. A real-life server always end up being a bit \"dirty\". Also, you need to (progressively) learn how to solve issues when you encounter them. Reach for [help](/community/help) with detailed symptoms of what you are trying to do and what is happening, and fix the issues. Over time, you will get a much better control over your server than just blindly reinstalling every time.\n"

You should perform backup regularly and keep them in a safe and different physical location from your server. More info on [the backup documentation](/admin/backups).\n"
