The backup strategy you implement should be tailored to the importance of the services and data you are managing. For instance, backing up a test server will be of little interest, whereas when handling critical data for an NGO or business, backups become much more vital. In these cases, it’s crucial to store backups in one, or ideally **several** locations.\n"
