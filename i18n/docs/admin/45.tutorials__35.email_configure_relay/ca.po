"An SMTP relay is basically a third party hosted SMTP server that will send emails on behalf of your own SMTP server (Postfix service on YunoHost).\n"
"Once setup correctly on YunoHost, its operation is transparent, both for you and for your correspondents: they will see emails as coming from your YunoHost main URL, but all the sending will be delegated to the SMTP relay you have chosen and configured.\n"

msgid "It's important to note that using an SMTP relay has to be seen as a (big) compromise in the world of self-hosting. Indeed, when using an SMTP relay, not only a third party sends emails on your behalf, but it has full access to the content of all the emails you'll send and can also possibly modify them (For example, by default, MailJet rewrites the html hyperlinks contained in your emails, in order to track the activity of your correspondents). Be also aware that an SMTP relay is setup for your whole YunoHost server: you can't choose which emails or which users go through it because all future emails will.\n"

msgid "Beyond the privacy considerations above, an SMTP relay can impose technical limitations that one would not have if port 25 was open. For example, with most relays, if a user of your YunoHost server declares **an external \"forwarding address\"** in order to automatically forward messages received on your YunoHost server to another mailbox, **such forwarding will not work** for emails originating from outside your server, without any warning. Indeed, relays generally require that the messages they forward have a sender address from your domain (to fight spam and preserve the reputation of their services), which is not the case for an \"automatic forward\" where the original sender of the mail is kept; the message is then blocked by the relay (which, normally, warns your YunoHost admin, but only afterwards)\n"
