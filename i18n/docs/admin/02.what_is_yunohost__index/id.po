It is a copylefted libre software project maintained by volunteers. Technically, it can be seen as a server distribution based on [Debian GNU/Linux](https://debian.org).\n"

We do not sell services, we do not host or control your data or services in any way, and we have no intention or interest in monetizing anything. We also do not offer any formal guarantees. Our goal is simply to develop and maintain YunoHost in the hope that it contributes to a more decentralized internet and empowers people to reclaim autonomy over their digital services and technology. That said, we do our best to provide community support, and commercial support may be available through third parties if needed.\n"

msgid "**YunoHost as a project is *not* apolitical.** By its very nature, YunoHost promotes a decentralized internet and technologies that empower people. We reject the flawed notion that technology is inherently neutral, or that software projects should remain neutral. Many contributors to the project remain vigilant about the social and political implications of technological developments, and emphasize the importance of solidarity and alignment with broader movements such as feminism, LGBTQIA+ rights and visibility, environmental justice and social justice. We stand firmly against fascism, sexism, racism, xenophobia, [bigotry](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry), ableism, imperialism, extractivism, [eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics), and right-wing libertarianism. If you are not aligned with these values, you are encouraged to *not* use YunoHost and look for a different system.\n"

While there is no strict limit—since performance depends heavily on your specific setup — , we estimate that some technical adjustments may be necessary when reaching 250~500 user accounts, or about 50 simultaneous users on resource-intensive apps. That said, YunoHost can comfortably handle hosting a website or several lightweight services, even with thousands of daily visitors.\n"
