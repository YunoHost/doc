"- the disks of a cluster mounted with disks of the same brand can fail almost at the same time within a few hours\n"
"- without monitoring the health of the disks, there is a good chance that the failure of one disk in the cluster will only be noticed when a second one fails (\\>\\<)\n"
"- if you don't have a spare disk, the delay in purchasing one may result in the other disk crashing\n"
"- a half-functional disk that produces errors can propagate its error through the cluster\n"
"- the disk connectors or the RAID controller can also produce errors or fail\n"
"- the more complex you make the architecture with many components, the more likely it is that one of them will fail\n"
