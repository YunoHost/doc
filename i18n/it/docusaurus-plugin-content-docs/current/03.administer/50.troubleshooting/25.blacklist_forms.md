title: Form per togliersi dalle blacklist
---

Può succedere talvolta che il tuo IP venga inserito nelle blacklist da parte di alcuni provider di email o da servizi anti-spam.

## Prova il tuo server

To check your Email deliverability, YunoHost provide some tests avilables in the Diagnosis tool. This tools evalutes  a lot of configuration and ip reputation points. It gives you also an indicator if some mails are blocked inside the mail queue (waiting to be sent).
all the points evaluated by [the well known mail-tester.com](https://www.mail-tester.com) except for mail content (usefull if you prepare a newsletter).

However, if you have a doubt on the internal diagnosis results, you could check on external tools:

- by sending an emails : [Mail tester](https://www.mail-tester.com)
- by providing the public ip : [MultiRBL Valli](https://multirbl.valli.org/) or [Whatismyip](https://whatismyipaddress.com/blacklist-check)

## Check your mail logs

This command can help you to summarize which emails has been refused by other SMTP server and why.

```bash
cat /var/log/mail.log | grep "deferred" | sed -E "s/(:[0-9][0-9]).+</\1\t/g" | sed -E "s/>.+dsn/\terror/g" | sed -E "s/, status=deferred \(/ /g" | sed -E "s/\)$//g"
```

See [the list of SMTP return code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SMTP_server_return_codes) from wikipedia.

## Untestable email providers

YunoHost is only able to test generic blacklist using the DNS RBL mechanism. However, Gmail, Microsoft, Yahoo or Free maintains their own blacklisting mechanism, so in some situation you may need to contact their teams through dedicated forms or use dedicated tools.

## Get alert about emails sent without SPF or DKIM

If you use your own domains and think that some mails are sent by unauthorized servers (so without SPF/DKIM), you  get report about this mail with.

```text
_dmarc.DOMAIN 3600 IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=none; fo=1; rua=mailto:example@domain.tld!10m"
```
