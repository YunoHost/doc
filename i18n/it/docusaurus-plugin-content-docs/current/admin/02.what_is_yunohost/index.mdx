YunoHost è un **sistema operativo** che mira a rendere il più semplice possibile l'amministrazione di un **server**  e quindi a permettere ad un numero sempre maggiore di persone di avvicinarsi al [self-hosting](/admin/about_self_hosting), assicurandosi che la gestione del server rimanga affidabile, sicura ed etica. Si tratta di un progetto basato su software libero e copyleft gestito esclusivamente da volontari. Tecnicamente YunoHost può essere vista come una distribuzione basata su [Debian GNU/Linux](https://debian.org).

YunoHost can be installed on [many kinds of hardware](/admin/get_started/install_on), either at home or on a remote server (VPS).

## Origine

YunoHost è stata creata nel febbraio 2012 dopo qualcosa del genere:

> "Shit, I'm too lazy to reconfigure my mail server... Beudbeud, how were you able to get your little server running with LDAP?"
> <small>*Kload, February 2012*</small>

Tutto ciò che serviva era un'interfaccia di amministrazione per il server di Beudbeud per creare qualcosa di utilizzabile, così Kload ha deciso di svilupparne una. Alla fine, dopo aver automatizzato diverse configurazioni e aver inserito alcune applicazioni web, YunoHost versione 1 è stato completato.

Notando il crescente entusiasmo intorno a YunoHost e al self-hosting in generale, gli sviluppatori originari e i nuovi collaboratori hanno deciso di iniziare a lavorare alla versione 2, una versione più estensibile, più potente, più facile da usare e che prepara una bella tazza di caffè equo-solidale per gli elfi della Lapponia.

Il nome **YunoHost** deriva dal gergo "Y U NO Host". Il [meme Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme) dovrebbe illustrarlo:

## What YunoHost is not?

YunoHost is *not* an enterprise or a for-profit entity. It is developed and maintained by volunteers. We do not sell services, we do not host or control your data or services in any way, and we have no intention or interest in monetizing anything. We also do not offer any formal guarantees. Our goal is simply to develop and maintain YunoHost in the hope that it contributes to a more decentralized internet and empowers people to reclaim autonomy over their digital services and technology. That said, we do our best to provide community support, and commercial support may be available through third parties if needed.

YunoHost as a project is *not* apolitical. By its very nature, YunoHost promotes a decentralized internet and technologies that empower people. We reject the flawed notion that technology is inherently neutral, or that software projects should remain neutral. Many contributors to the project remain vigilant about the social and political implications of technological developments, and emphasize the importance of solidarity and alignment with broader movements such as feminism, LGBTQIA+ rights and visibility, environmental justice and social justice. We stand firmly against fascism, sexism, racism, xenophobia, [bigotry](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry), ableism, imperialism, extractivism, [eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics), and right-wing libertarianism. If you are not aligned with these values, you are encouraged to *not* use YunoHost and look for a different system.

YunoHost is *not* designed to "scale" in the traditional sense. It is intended for a relatively modest number of user accounts and simultaneous users. While there is no strict limit—since performance depends heavily on your specific setup — , we estimate that some technical adjustments may be necessary when reaching 250~500 user accounts, or about 50 simultaneous users on resource-intensive apps. That said, YunoHost can comfortably handle hosting a website or several lightweight services, even with thousands of daily visitors.

YunoHost is primarily designed for people who want things to "just work". Of course, it’s not perfect — we're constantly working to improve the user experience, robustness, and simplicity. Though YunoHost is "tinkerable", the first target public is *not* power users with complex or highly customized use cases in mind. We encourage you to keep your setup as simple as possible. That said, you are than welcome to experiment and share your feedback with us!

YunoHost is *not* designed to be a *heavy* multi-tenant solution for providing services to completely separate organizations across different domains. While you *can* manage multiple domains and subdomains — such as hosting apps for friends, colleagues, an association — you should keep in mind that there is no strict isolation between apps. Under the hood, all applications share the same system and environment.

(Note for power users) YunoHost does not use "hard" containerization technologies such as Docker for its apps. This is partly for historical reasons, but also to keep the system lightweight — both in terms of resource usage and technical complexity. That said, we do take security seriously: applications run under dedicated user accounts with limited privileges and capabilities, and we're continuously working to enhance the system’s security.
