:::danger
This setup is mainly meant for local testing by advanced users. Due to limitations on WSL's side (changing IP address, notably), selfhosting from it can be tricky and will not be described here.

## <FAIcon icon="fa-list-alt"/> Pre-requisites

- Windows 10 and above
- Administration rights
- Windows Subsystem for Linux, installed from the Optional Features menu of Windows
- *Recommended:* Windows Terminal (Preview) app, installed from the Microsoft Store. Much better than the standard Terminal, as it offers shortcuts to the WSL distros.
- A computer or a smartphone to read this guide and access your server.

## Introduction

WSL is a nice feature of Windows 10, making Linux pseudo-distributions available through command line. Let's say pseudo, because even though they are not really like virtual machines, they rely on virtualization capacities that make their integration with Windows almost seamless.
Docker for Windows can now rely on WSL instead of Hyper-V, for example.

:::warning
Bear in mind, this setup itself is *not* a container of any kind. If something breaks, there is no rollback capability.  
You may need to delete the Debian distro altogether and restore it whole.

## Install Debian 12

Let's install YunoHost into its own distro, not altering the default one. In a PowerShell terminal:

```bash
# Let's go in your home directory and prepare the working directories
cd ~
mkdir -p WSL\YunoHost
# Download the Debian appx package and unzip it
curl.exe -L -o debian.zip https://aka.ms/wsl-debian-gnulinux
Expand-Archive .\debian.zip -DestinationPath .\debian
# Import the Debian base into a new distro
wsl --import YunoHost ~\WSL\YunoHost ~\debian\install.tar.gz --version 2
# Cleanup
rmdir .\debian -R
```

You can now access it: run `wsl.exe -d YunoHost`

It is under Debian 9 Stretch, so let's upgrade it:

```bash
# In WSL
sudo sed -i 's/stretch/bookworm/g' /etc/apt/sources.list`
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt dist-upgrade
```

## Prevent WSL from tweaking configuration files

Edit `/etc/wsl.conf` and put the following code in it:

```text
[network]
generateHosts = false
generateResolvConf = false
```

## Force the use of iptables-legacy

Somehow the YunoHost post-installation does not like `nf_tables`, the new software replacing `iptables`.
We can still explicitely use the good ol' `iptables` though:

```bash
# In WSL
sudo update-alternatives --set iptables /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy
sudo update-alternatives --set ip6tables /usr/sbin/ip6tables-legacy
```

## Install Systemd

Debian on WSL does not have `systemd`, a service configuration software.
This is a key element for YunoHost, and for any decent Debian distro (seriously MS, what the heck). Let's install it:

1. Install dotNET runtime:

    ```bash
    # In WSL
    wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/debian/12/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
    sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y dotnet-sdk-3.1
    ```

2. Install [Genie](https://github.com/arkane-systems/genie):

    ```bash
    # In WSL
    # Add their repository
    echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://wsl-translinux.arkane-systems.net/apt/ /" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wsl-translinux.list
    # Install Genie
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y systemd-genie
    ```

## Install YunoHost

```bash
# In WSL
# Let's switch to the root user, if you were not already
sudo su
# Initialize the Genie bottle to have systemd running
genie -s
# Your hostname should have been appended with "-wsl"
# Install YunoHost
curl https://install.yunohost.org | bash -s -- -a
```

### Access the command line

Always call `genie -s` while starting your distro.

`wsl -d YunoHost -e genie -s`

## Backup and restore the distro

### Make your first distro backup

As said before, there is no rollback capability. So let's export your fresh distro. In PowerShell:

```bash
cd ~
wsl --export YunoHost .\WSL\YunoHost.tar.gz
```

### In case of crash, delete and restore the whole distro

```bash
cd ~
wsl --unregister YunoHost
wsl --import YunoHost .\WSL\YunoHost .\WSL\YunoHost.tar.gz --version 2
```
