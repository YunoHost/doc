## <FAIcon icon="fa-cog"/> Proceed with the initial configuration

:::tip
If you are in the process of restoring a server using a YunoHost backup, you should skip this step and instead [restore the backup instead of the postinstall step](/backup#restoring-during-the-postinstall).
:::

:::note
This documentation assumes you're on the same local network as your YunoHost installation.
[Find out its IP address](/install/post_install/finding_the_local_ip) before continuing.

For a VPS, please use the public IP address instead of the local domain or address.

    :::warning
    During the first visit, you will very likely encounter a security warning related to the certificate used by the server. For now, your server uses a self-signed certificate. You will later be able to add a certificate automatically recognized by web browsers as described in the [certificate documentation](/administer/admin_guide/domains/certificate).  For now, you should add a security exception to accept the current certificate. (Though, PLEASE, do not take the habit of blindly accepting this kind of security alert!)

    You should then land on this page:

    You can also perform the postinstallation with the command `yunohost tools postinstall` directly on the server, or [via SSH](/administer/admin_guide/command_line).

### <FAIcon icon="fa-globe"/> Main domain

<details>
<summary>WSL specific configuration</summary>

You will have to choose a fake domain, since it will not be accessible from outside.
For example, `ynh.wsl`. The tricky part is advertising this domain to your host.

Alter your `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` file. You should have a line starting by `::1`, update it or add it if needed to get:

```text
::1    ynh.wsl localhost
```

If you want to create subdomains, do not forget to add them in the `hosts` file too:

```text
::1    ynh.wsl subdomain.ynh.wsl localhost
```
</details>

This will be the domain used by your server's users to access the **authentication portal**. You can later add other domains, and change which one is the main domain if needed.

- If you're new to self-hosting and do not already have a domain name, we recommend using a **.nohost.me** / **.noho.st** / **.ynh.fr** (e.g. `homersimpson.nohost.me`). Provided that it's not already taken, the domain will be configured automatically and you won't need any further configuration step. Please note that the downside is that you won't have full-control over the DNS configuration.
- If you already own a domain name, you probably want to use it here. You will later need to configure DNS records as explained [here](/install/post_install/dns_config).

:::tip
Yes, you *have to* configure a domain name. If you don't have any domain name and don't want a **.nohost.me** / **.noho.st** / **.ynh.fr** either, you can set up a dummy domain such as `yolo.test` and tweak your **local** `/etc/hosts` file such that this dummy domain [points to the appropriate IP, as explained here](/administer/tutorials/domains/dns_local_network).

### <FAIcon icon="fa-key"/> First user

The first user is now created at this stage. You should pick a username and a reasonably complex password. (We cannot stress enough that the password should be **robust**!) This user will be added to the Admins group, and will therefore be able to access the user portal, the web admin interface, and connect [via **SSH**](/administer/admin_guide/command_line) or [**SFTP**](/administer/tutorials/filezilla). Admins will also receive emails sent to `root@yourdomain.tld` and `admin@yourdomain.tld`: these emails may be used to send technical informations or alerts. You can later add additional users, which you can also add to the Admins group.

This user replaces the old `admin` user, which some old documentation page may still refer to. In which case: just replace `admin` with your username.

## <FAIcon icon="fa-stethoscope"/> Run the initial diagnosis

Once the postinstall is done, you should be able to actually log in the web admin interface using the credentials of the first user you just created.

The diagnosis system is meant to provide an easy way to validate that all critical aspects of your server are properly configured - and guide you in how to fix issues. The diagnosis will run twice a day and send an alert if issues are detected.

:::tip
**Don't run away** ! The first time you run the diagnosis, it is quite expected to see a bunch of yellow/red alerts because you typically need to [configure DNS records](/install/post_install/dns_config) (if not using a `.nohost.me`/`noho.st`/`ynh.fr` domain), add a swapfile if not enough ram as well as [port forwarding](/install/post_install/isp_box_config) on your home's router.
:::

:::tip
If an alert is not relevant (for example because you don't intend on using a specific feature), it is perfectly fine to flag the issue as 'ignored' by going in the webadmin > Diagnosis, and clicking the ignore button for this specifc issue.
:::

:::warning
Especially, installations on WSL or virtual machines will likely not be reachable from outside without further network configuration on Virtualbox and your machine.

## <FAIcon icon="fa-lock"/> Get a Let's Encrypt certificate

Once you configured DNS records and port forwarding (if needed), you should be able to install a Let's Encrypt certificate. This will get rid of the spooky security warning from earlier for new visitors.

For more detailed instructions, or to lean more about SSL/TLS certificates, see [the corresponding page here](/administer/admin_guide/domains/certificate).

## <img src="/img/tada.png" height="30"/> Congratz!

You now have a pretty well configured server. If you're new to YunoHost, we recommend to have a look at [the guided tour](/category/overview). You should also be able to [install your favourite applications](https://apps.yunohost.org/). Don't forget to [plan backups](/category/backups) !
