# Write documentation

## Online

This site allows to edit content directly online.

You can edit any page by pressing `ESC` on your keyboard or by clicking the "Edit" button on the bottom-right side of your screen. You will be able to preview your changes by pressing `ESC` again or by clicking the "preview" button.

To create a new page, you can enter the URL and edit the page from there.

Once edited, you are able to submit your change by filling an email address.

## Via GitHub

The YunoHost documentation is managed through a [git repository](https://github.com/YunoHost/doc). You can send pull-requests, and do not forget to report your issues.

Because the online editor doesn't support uploading files, using git is the prefered way if you need to upload media (e.g. images).

## Syntax

This page uses the markdown syntax, please refer to the [documentation](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for further information.
