# Internet service providers

<a class="btn btn-lg btn-default" href="/isp_box_config"> Main configuration box</a>

Here is a non-comprehensive list of internet service providers by country, which contains criteria about tolerance to self-hosting.

A "no" may cause problems for using your server or may require you to make additional configuration changes. Status in brackets indicates the default behavior.

A list of French and Belgian ISPs is available on the [french page](/isp_fr).
