# Docker and YunoHost

<div class="alert alert-danger">
<b>
YunoHost doesn’t support Docker officially since issues with versions 2.4+.
In question, YunoHost 2.4+ doesn’t work anymore on Docker
because YunoHost requires systemd and Docker has chosen to not support it natively (and
there are other problems link to the firewall and services).
