#Self-hosting

#### Definition
**Self-hosting** is having a server at home in order to host personnal data and services on it.

#### Administrator responsibilities
Self-hosting implies responsibilities, if you want to host a website, [emails](email) and have [an instant messaging system](XMPP) running, the server needs to stay online all the time, 24/7.

Problems can happen and the server could become unavailable: a power outage, Internet access loss, etc.

If you use the [email system](email_en) and your server becomes unavailable, emails destined to the server will be re-sent under 3 to 7 days.

#### Self-hosting contraints
* Slow transfer speed. With ADSL, upload is approximately 1/10 of the rate of download. For instance: 1 Mb/s download speed would give an upload speed of 100 kb/s;
* Availability must be 24/7;
* Move;

#### Self-hosting issues
* Anonymity, private life;
* Reappropriation of personnal data and services;
* Decentralization, distributed networks;
