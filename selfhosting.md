#Self-hosting

#### Definition
**Self-hosting** consist to host at home its server, its data and its services.

#### Administrator responsibilities
If you want to serve a web site, the [email system](email) and [instant messaging](XMPP), the server need to stay turn on all the time, 24h/24 and 7d/7.

Self-hosting results availability of the server to users hosted and/or to externals people consulting it.

Problems can happen making server unavailable: power outage, loss of access to the Internet…etc.

If you use the [email system](email_en), and your server is unavailable, emails for the server will be sent under 3 to 7 days.
