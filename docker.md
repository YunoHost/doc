# Docker and YunoHost

<div class="alert alert-danger">
<b>
Yunohost doesn't support Docker officially since issues with versions 2.4+.
In question, YunoHost 2.4 doesn't work anymore on Docker
because YunoHost requires systemd and Docker has chosen to not support it natively (and
there are other problems link to the firewall and services).
