* It's okay if you can only have 32-bit versions, just be sure that you downloaded the 32-bit image previously.
* 256MB RAM is the minimum required, but at least 512MB is recommended (1Go or more if you can).
* 8GB storage is the minimum required for the system, add whatever is necessary for your apps.

<br>

You will have to select your ISO image here, then you should see the YunoHost's boot screen.

If you encounter the error "VT-x is not available", you need probably need to enable Virtualization in the BIOS of your computer.
