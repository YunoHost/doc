msgid "`root`, a.k.a \"god on the machine\", still exists however, and being able to access the root account can sometimes be useful. For example, because LDAP (the user database powering YunoHost account) is broken. In this case, you may be able to connect to root via SSH *from the local network*, via a direct screen/keyboard access, or via a rescue console provided by your VPS provider - depending on the nature of your server.\n"
