"Everything starts with the special user **admin**. This is the administrator "
"of the machine who can install, configure and manage things on the server "
"through the web administration interface, or via SSH and the command line "
"interface. *(If you are already familiar with GNU/Linux, it is quite similar "
"to root. YunoHost has this additional 'admin' user for several technical "
"reasons.)*"

"The administrator can create users and install applications, among other "
"admin actions. Users automatically have their own email address when they "
"get created. Users will also be able to connect to the user portal (SSO) to "
"access applications. Some applications can typically be installed either as "
"publicly-accessible, or as private, i.e. only some users will have access to "
"it."

"Applications and their features of the server rely on different services to "

"are constantly running on the server to ensure various tasks are done, such "
