"Self-hosting means owning and administrating your own server, typically at "
"home, to host your **personal data and services** yourself instead of "
"relying exclusively on third parties. For instance, you can self-host your "
"blog, such that it 'lives' on a machine that you have control of, instead of "
"having it on somebody else's computer (a.k.a. FAANG or The Cloud) in "
"exchange for money, advertisements, or private data."

"Self-hosting implies owning a server. **A server is a computer that is "
"typically accessible on the network 24/7**, and usually does not have a "
"screen or keyboard (it is instead controlled remotely). Contrary to a "
"popular belief, a server is not necessarily a huge and extra-powerful "
"machine: nowadays, a small, ~$30 ARM board is adequate for self-hosting."

"Self-hosting is not about making \"your Internet\" more secure and does not "
"provide anonymity by itself. Instead, it is about being autonomous and in "
"control of your services and data — which also means being responsible for "
"them."
