"An SMTP relay is basically a third party hosted SMTP server that will send "
"emails on behalf of your own SMTP server (Postfix service on YunoHost).  "
"Once setup correctly on YunoHost, its operation is transparent, both for you "
"and for your correspondents: they will see emails as coming from your "
"YunoHost main URL, but all the sending will be delegated to the SMTP relay "
"you have chosen and configured."

"It's important to note that using an SMTP relay has to be seen as a (big) "
"compromise in the world of self-hosting. Indeed, when using an SMTP relay, "
"not only a third party sends emails on your behalf, but it has full access "
"to the content of all the emails you'll send and can also possibly modify "
"them (For example, by default, MailJet rewrites the html hyperlinks "
"contained in your emails, in order to track the activity of your "
"correspondents). Be also aware that an SMTP relay is setup for your whole "
"YunoHost server: you can't choose which emails or which users go through it "
"because all future emails will."

"Beyond the privacy considerations above, an SMTP relay can impose technical "
"limitations that one would not have if port 25 was open. For example, with "
"most relays, if a user of your YunoHost server declares **an external "
"\"forwarding address\"** in order to automatically forward messages received "
"on your YunoHost server to another mailbox, **such forwarding will not "
"work** for emails originating from outside your server, without any warning. "
"Indeed, relays generally require that the messages they forward have a "
"sender address from your domain (to fight spam and preserve the reputation "
"of their services), which is not the case for an \"automatic forward\" where "
"the original sender of the mail is kept; the message is then blocked by the "
"relay (which, normally, warns your YunoHost admin, but only afterwards)"
