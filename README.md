# YunoHost Documentation

This repository contains the code for [the YunoHost documentation](https://doc.yunohost.org). It is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io), a modern static website generator.

Issues are to be reported on [the YunoHost bugtracker](https://github.com/YunoHost/issues/issues).

App-specific documentation doesn't happen here but in the package/app repositories themselves. More info in [the dedicated page](https://doc.yunohost.org/packaging/doc/).

Checkout **<https://doc.yunohost.org/dev/doc/>** for more info on how to work on documentation, and **<https://doc.yunohost.org/dev/translation>** for more info on how to work on translation.
