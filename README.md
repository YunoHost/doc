# YunoHost Documentation

This repository contains the code for [the YunoHost documentation](https://doc.yunohost.org).

It is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io), a modern static website generator.

Please report issues on [the YunoHost bugtracker](https://github.com/YunoHost/issues/issues).

> [!WARNING]  
> Package/apps documentation should be done in the package/app repository itself, under the `/doc` folder.  
> You can learn about it here: <https://doc.yunohost.org/packaging/doc/>

The how-to of this repository is [available online](https://doc.yunohost.org/dev/doc/)
and also [in this repository](./docs/dev/05.doc/index.mdx).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Translation support is manual and costly for translators.  
> We are working on a better system, integrated with Weblate (https://translate.yunohost.org)  
> This system may require you to restart some of your translation from scratch.  
> We suggest you to wait for this system unless your changes are small.  
> You may refer to [the internationalization readme](./README-I18N.md) to learn more about it.
